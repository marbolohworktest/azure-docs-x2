## About blob index tags

Blob index tags categorize data in your storage account using key-value tag attributes. These tags are automatically indexed and exposed as a searchable multi-dimensional index to easily find data. This article shows you how to set, get, and find data using blob index tags.

Blob index tags aren't supported for storage accounts with hierarchical namespace enabled. To learn more about the blob index tag feature along with known issues and limitations, see [Manage and find Azure Blob data with blob index tags](../../articles/storage/blobs/storage-manage-find-blobs.md).
