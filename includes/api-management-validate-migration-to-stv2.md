## Verify migration

To verify that the migration was successful, when the status changes to **Online**, check the [platform version](../articles/api-management/compute-infrastructure.md#how-do-i-know-which-platform-hosts-my-api-management-instance) of your API Management instance. After successful migration, the value is `stv2` or `stv2.1`.
