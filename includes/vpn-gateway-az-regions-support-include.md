The steps in this article use the gateway SKU **VpnGw2AZ**, which is a SKU that supports Azure availability zones. Some regions don't support availability zones. If you want to deploy to a region that's different than the example values in this article, make sure availability zones are supported for that region. If availability zones aren't supported, use a non-AZ SKU instead. For more information, see [Availability zone service and regional support](../articles/reliability/availability-zones-service-support.md). For more information about SKUs, see [About gateway SKUs](../articles/vpn-gateway/about-gateway-skus.md).
