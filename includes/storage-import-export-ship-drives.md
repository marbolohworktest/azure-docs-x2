FedEx, UPS, or DHL can be used to ship the package to Azure datacenter. If you want to use a carrier other than FedEx/DHL, contact Azure Data Box Operations team at `adbops@microsoft.com`

* Provide a valid FedEx, UPS, or DHL carrier account number for use by Microsoft to return the drives.
  * A FedEx, UPS, or DHL account number is required for shipping drives back from the US and Europe locations.
    * A DHL account number is preferred for shipping drives back from Asia and Australia locations.
    * If you don't have an account number, create a [FedEx](https://www.fedex.com/us/oadr/) or [DHL](http://www.dhl.com/) carrier account.
* When shipping your packages, you must follow the [Microsoft Azure Service Terms](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/services-terms/).
* Properly package your disks to avoid potential damage and delays in processing. Follow these recommended best practices:
    * Wrap the disk drives securely with protective bubble wrap. Bubble wrap acts as a shock absorber and protects the drive from impact during transit. Before shipping, ensure that the entire drive is thoroughly covered and cushioned.
    * Place the wrapped drives within a foam shipper. The foam shipper provides extra protection and keeps the drive securely in place during transit.
