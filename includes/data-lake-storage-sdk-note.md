> [!NOTE]
> [Multi-protocol access on Data Lake Storage](../articles/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-multi-protocol-access.md) enables applications to use both Blob APIs and Data Lake Storage Gen2 APIs to work with data in storage accounts with hierarchical namespace (HNS) enabled. When working with capabilities unique to Data Lake Storage Gen2, such as directory operations and ACLs, use the Data Lake Storage Gen2 APIs, as shown in this article.
>
> When choosing which APIs to use in a given scenario, consider the workload and the needs of your application, along with the [known issues](../articles/storage/blobs/data-lake-storage-known-issues.md#blob-storage-apis) and [impact of HNS on workloads and applications](../articles/storage/blobs/upgrade-to-data-lake-storage-gen2.md#impact-on-workloads-and-applications).
