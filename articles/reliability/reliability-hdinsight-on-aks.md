# Reliability in Azure HDInsight on Azure Kubernetes Service

> [!Note]
> We will retire Azure HDInsight on AKS on January 31, 2025. Before January 31, 2025, you will need to migrate your workloads to [Microsoft Fabric](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-fabric) or an equivalent Azure product to avoid abrupt termination of your workloads. The remaining clusters on your subscription will be stopped and removed from the host.
>
> Only basic support will be available until the retirement date.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is currently in preview. The [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) include more legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, in preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability. For information about this specific preview, see [Azure HDInsight on AKS preview information](/azure/hdinsight-aks/preview). For questions or feature suggestions, please submit a request on [AskHDInsight](https://aka.ms/askhdinsight) with the details and follow us for more updates on [Azure HDInsight Community](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/14313521/).

This article describes reliability support in [Azure HDInsight on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](../hdinsight-aks/overview.md), and [disaster recovery and business continuity](#disaster-recovery-and-business-continuity). 


## Availability zone support

[!INCLUDE [next step](includes/reliability-availability-zone-description-include.md)]

Azure HDInsight on AKS supports availability zone by leveraging Azure Kubernetes Service's ability to create zone redundant node pools. You can select which availability zones to deploy the cluster pool and cluster during their creation. Once the cluster pool or cluster is created, you can't change the availability zones.

### Prerequisites

- Availability zones are only supported for cluster pool version >= `1.2` and cluster version >= `1.2.1`.
- Azure HDInsight on AKS only has one default SKU and it supports AZ as long as the Azure region has AZ support.

  Below regions don't support AZ:

  | Americas         | Europe               | Middle East   | Africa             | Asia Pacific   |
  |------------------|----------------------|---------------|--------------------|----------------|
  | West US          | Germany North        |               |                    |                |
- Some VM SKUs may not support all availability zones in a region. If you select those SKUs, HDInsight on AKS cluster pools or clusters don't support corresponding availability zones either.

### SLA improvements

There are no increased SLAs for Azure HDInsight on AKS clusters with availability zones enabled.

#### Create a resource with availability zone enabled

- Cluster Pools
  You can select one or more availability zones during cluster pool creation after you select the region.

- Clusters
  You can select one or more availability zones during cluster creation.

### Fault tolerance

To prepare for availability zone failure, it's recommended to over-provision capacity of service to ensure that your cluster can tolerate the loss of capacity from one availability zone down and continue to function without degraded performance during zone-wide outages. For instance, if you enable 3 availability zones, your cluster should tolerate 1/3 of the nodes down (round up to the nearest integer).

### Zone down experience

Azure HDInsight on AKS service is zone redundant. During a zone-wide outage, the customer should expect degradation of performance due to capacity drop. Customers can still create new cluster pools and clusters in the availability zones that are not impacted. Existing clusters can function with reduced capacity. Individual open source workloads recommendations and best practices are provided on the documentation. 

## Disaster recovery and business continuity

[!INCLUDE [introduction to disaster recovery](includes/reliability-disaster-recovery-description-include.md)]

Azure HDInsight on AKS control plane service and databases are deployed across regions of Azure. Among these regions, the Azure HDInsight on AKS instances and database instances are isolated. When an outage at region level occurs, one region is down. All the resources in this region, including the RP (Resource Provider) of Azure HDInsight on AKS control plane, database of Azure HDInsight on AKS control plane and all customer clusters in this region. In this case, we can only wait for the regional outage to end. When the zonal outage is fully recovered, Azure HDInsight on AKS service is back and all customer clusters are back to normalcy. It's possible you may encounter some problems due to data inconsistency after the outage and may need a manual fix based on your application workloads.

### Multi-region disaster recovery

Azure HDInsight on AKS currently doesn't support cross-region failover. Improving business continuity using cross region high availability disaster recovery requires architectural designs of higher complexity and higher cost. Customers may choose to design their own solution to back up key data and job status across different regions.

#### Outage detection, notification, and management

- Use Azure monitoring tools on HDInsight on AKS to detect abnormal behavior in the cluster and set corresponding alert notifications. You can enable Log Analytics in various ways and use managed Prometheus service with Azure Grafana dashboards for monitoring. For more information, see [Azure Monitor integration](../hdinsight-aks/concept-azure-monitor-integration.md).  

- Subscribe to Azure health alerts to be notified about service issues, planned maintenance, health and security advisories for a subscription, service, or region. Health notifications that include the issue cause and resolute ETA help you to better execute failover and failbacks. For more information, see [Manage service health](../hdinsight-aks/service-health.md) and [Azure Service Health documentation](/azure/service-health/).

### Single-region disaster recovery

Currently, Azure HDInsight on AKS only has one standard service offering and clusters are created in a single-region geography. Customers are responsible for diaster recovery settings based on the application requirements.

### Capacity and proactive disaster recovery resiliency

Azure HDInsight on AKS and its customers operate under the Shared responsibility model, which means that the customer must address disaster recovery requirements for the service they deploy and control. To ensure that recovery is proactive, customers should always predeploy secondaries because there's no guarantee of capacity at time of impact for those who haven't preallocated.

Unlike HDInsight, the Virtual Machines used in HDInsight on AKS clusters require the same Quota as Azure VMs. For more information, see [Capacity planning](../hdinsight-aks/virtual-machine-recommendation-capacity-planning.md#capacity-planning).
