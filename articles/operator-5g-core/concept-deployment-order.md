# Deployment order for clusters, network functions, and observability 

Mobile Packet Core resources have minimal ordering constraints. To bring up network functions, the cluster services must be already running successfully. The same set of cluster services can be reused for multiple network functions and the cluster services must be deployed on every cluster that hosts the network functions.

## Mobile Packet Core resource deployment order

Deploy resources in the following order. Note that the Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/clusterServices resource must be deployed first. All other resources can be deployed in any order or in parallel.
  
Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/clusterServices 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/amfDeployments 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/smfDeployments 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/nrfDeployments 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/nssfDeployments 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/upfDeployments 

Microsoft.MobilePacketCore/observabilityServices
