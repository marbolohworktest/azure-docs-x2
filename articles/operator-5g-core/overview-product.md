> [!NOTE]
> Azure Operator 5G Core Preview is provided only for 5G SA network functions.

**Network functions used for 5G SA:** 
- **Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)** - AMF is responsible for the access and mobility management of the mobile subscribers. It is the point of contact for all mobile users in the core network. It maintains connections with the Radio Access Network (RAN) to transport signaling messages to and from the users.
- **Session Management Function (SMF)** - SMF provides session management at the highest level. It controls the creation, modification, and deletion of Protocol Data Units (PDU) sessions, providing data access from the User Equipment (UE) to one or more data networks.
- **User Plane Function (UPF)** - UPF is a fundamental component of the 5G core infrastructure system architecture, responsible for packet processing, traffic aggregation, and management functions to the edge of the network. It also provides an IP anchor point for Intra/Inter Radio Access Technology (RAT) mobility while implementing the user plane part of policy enforcement, traffic usage reporting, and lawful intercept functionality.  
- **Network Slice Selection Function (NSSF)** - NSSF supports network slice selection capabilities in the 5G network. This functionality is used by other consumer NFs such as AMF during UE procedures to ensure that the slice-specific resources (AMF, SMF, UPF) are used for the respective procedures.
- **Network Repository Function (NRF)** - NRF is responsible for the management of different NF instances and their respective profiles. It allows different NFs to dynamically register and de-register their services/profile whilst it also supports dynamic discovery of different NF instances based on their state and local policies. 

**Network functions used for 4G and 5G NSA:**  
- **Mobility Management Entity (MME)** - MME is key in managing signaling for UE access, mobility, and security in LTE networks. It establishes the connection and coordination between the UE and the evolved packet core, ensuring seamless mobility and authentication. 
- **Packet Data Network (PDN) Gateway Control Plane Function (PGW-C)** - PGW-C plays an essential role in managing session states and IP address allocation for UEs. It acts as the control plane interface between the mobile network and the PDN, orchestrating the flow of data sessions and maintaining network efficiency.  
- **PDN Gateway User Plane Function (PGW-U)** - PGW-U is responsible for the routing and forwarding of user data packets between the UE and external networks. It ensures efficient management and delivery of data traffic, maintaining the quality of service and experience for the end-user. 
- **Serving Gateway Control Plane Function (SGW-C)** - SGW-C oversees the creation and management of user plane tunnels in SGW. It is vital for maintaining session information and supporting UE mobility across different eNodeBs within the network.  
- **Serving Gateway User Plane Function (SGW-U)** - SGW-U facilitates the transfer of user data packets within the mobile network. It ensures that data packets are efficiently routed and forwarded to the right destination, supporting uninterrupted user mobility.

**Network functions used for 2G and 3G:**  
- **Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)** - GGSN serves as the gateway between the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) mobile network and external packet-switched networks. It is responsible for IP address assignment, QoS enforcement, and routing data from mobile users to external networks. 
- **Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)** - SGSN is responsible for the operation of GPRS and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) networks, managing mobile data sessions and mobility. It ensures continuous data connections and optimization as users move throughout the network, handling registration, authentication, and routing of packet data.

Any-G is built on top of Azure Operator Nexus and Azure – with flexible Network Function (NF) placement based on the operator use case. Different use cases drive  NF deployment topologies. Network Functions can be placed geographically closer to the users for scenarios such as consumer, low latency, and MEC or centralized for machine to machine (Internet of Things) and enterprise scenarios. Deployment is API driven regardless of the placement of the network functions.
