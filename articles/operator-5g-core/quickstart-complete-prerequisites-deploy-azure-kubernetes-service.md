# Quickstart: Complete the prerequisites to deploy Azure Operator 5G Core Preview on Azure Kubernetes Service

This article shows you how to prepare the prerequisite infrastructure required to deploy the Azure Operator 5G Core. The first section discusses the preparation of the Azure Kubernetes Service cluster; the second shows you how to modify the cluster to add extra accelerated networking interfaces - Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) interfaces, which we also refer to these interfaces interchangeably as data plane ports. Lastly, we include the preparation of the Azure loadbalncer and storage services required distribute traffic and store data from the cluster. 

## Prerequisites

To deploy on the Azure Kubernetes Service, you need the following configurations:

- [Resource Group/Subscription](../cost-management-billing/manage/create-enterprise-subscription.md)
- The [Azure Operator 5G Core release version and corresponding Kubernetes version](overview-product.md#compatibility)
- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) system and user node pool vm series and sizing](/azure/virtual-machines/dv5-dsv5-series) 
    - Recommended node series: system node - D8s_v5,  user node - D16s_v5
    - Recommended node count: system node-3, user node-8   
- Appropriate [roles and permissions](../role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal.yml) in your tenant to create the cluster and modify the Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets.
- Detailed Networks and subnet planning – [user defined routes](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-udr-overview.md) can be added to virtual networks and network interfaces as required.
- [Azure Active Directory/Entra Application ID](/entra/fundamentals/whatis)with subscription level contributor access. Throughout this article, leave unspecified settings as default.
- Express route connectivity - required to connect your Azure infrastructure to your on-premises infrastructure and exchange IP routes. The express route and required vpn gateway setup is outside the scope of this document. 

## Assign subnets for specific network functions

Azure assigns a virtual network address by default, but based on the network architecture, detailed network and subnet planning is required.

The reference deployment of Azure Operator 5G Core is a single cluster, with one virtual network and multiple constituent subnets as part of the same virtual network.

These components include:
- Azure virtual network address space - /12 
- Azure Kubernetes Services subnet –  /16
- All other subnets - /24

Additional IP subnets exist for the Access and Mobility Function (AMF) and User Plane Function (UPF). These subnets specifically require data plane ports for communication with external node elements including the radio access network (RAN).

|Infrastructure subnet  |Use  |
|---------|---------|
| Infrastructure subnet     |   storage and Azure key Vault      |
|AKS-services subnet     |  Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI)        |
|AO5GC_OAM subnet     |   operations and management; observability and inter-network function communications       |
|UPF_N3_subnet     | N3 accelerated network interface        |
|UPF_N6_subnet     | N6 accelerated network interface        |
|AMF_N2_subnet     | N2 accelerated network interface        |
|AMF_N2-LB_subnet     | SCTP loopback address         |
|UPF_N3-LB_subnet     | GTP-U loopback address        |
|UPF_N6-LB_subnet     | Data networks names (DNN) loopback addresses       |

The topology and quantity of vnets and subnets can differ based on your custom requirements. For more information, see [Quickstart: Use the Azure portal to create a virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) to create a virtual network.

> [!NOTE]
> In the reference deployment, as more clusters are added, more subnets are added to the same vnet.

## Create the Azure Kubernetes Cluster

To deploy an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster, you should have a basic understanding of [Kubernetes concepts](/azure/aks/concepts-clusters-workloads) and advanced knowledge of Azure networking, consistent with Azure Networking Certification. Additionally:

- If you don't have an [Azure subscription](../cost-management-billing/manage/create-enterprise-subscription.md), create an [Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/azure-account?ref=microsoft.com&utm_source=microsoft.com&utm_medium=docs&utm_campaign=visualstudio) before you begin.
- If you're unfamiliar with the Azure Cloud Shell, review [What is Azure Cloud Shell?](../cloud-shell/overview.md)
- Make sure that the identity you use to create your cluster has the appropriate minimum permissions. For more information on access and identity for AKS, see [Access and identity options for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](/azure/aks/concepts-identity).
 
Once you complete these steps, you can create the AKS cluster:

1. Navigate and sign in to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com).
2. On the Azure portal home page, select **Create a Resource**.
3. In the **Categories** section, select **Containers > Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**.
4. On the **Basics** tab:
    - Enter the **Subscription**, **Resource Group**, **Kubernetes cluster name**, **Availability zones**, and **AKS pricing tier** based on your Azure Operator 5G Core requirements.
    - Disable **Automatic upgrade**.
    - Select **Local accounts with Kubernetes RBAC** for the **Authentication and Authorization** method.
