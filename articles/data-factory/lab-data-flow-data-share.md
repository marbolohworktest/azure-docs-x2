# Data integration using Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share

[!INCLUDE [appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

As customers embark on their modern data warehouse and analytics projects, they require not only more data but also more visibility into their data across their data estate. This workshop dives into how improvements to Azure Data Factory and Azure Data Share simplify data integration and management in Azure. 

From enabling code-free ETL/ELT to creating a comprehensive view over your data, improvements in Azure Data Factory empower your data engineers to confidently bring in more data, and thus more value, to your enterprise. Azure Data Share allows you to do business to business sharing in a governed manner.

In this workshop, you use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to ingest data from Azure SQL Database into Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2). Once you land the data in the lake, you transform it via mapping data flows, data factory's native transformation service, and sink it into Azure Synapse Analytics. Then, you share the table with transformed data along with some extra data using Azure Data Share. 

The data used in this lab is New York City taxi data. To import it into your database in SQL Database, download the [taxi-data bacpac file](https://github.com/djpmsft/ADF_Labs/blob/master/sample-data/taxi-data.bacpac). Select the **Download raw file** option in GitHub.

- **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 storage account**: If you don't have an ADLS Gen2 storage account, learn how to [create an ADLS Gen2 storage account](../storage/common/storage-account-create.md).

- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: If you don't have an Azure Synapse Analytics workspace, learn how to [get started with Azure Synapse Analytics](../synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace.md).

- **Azure Data Factory**: If you don't have a data factory, see how to [create a data factory](./quickstart-create-data-factory-portal.md).

- **Azure Data Share**: If you don't have a data share, see how to [create a data share](../data-share/share-your-data.md#create-a-data-share-account).

## Set up your Azure Data Factory environment

In this section, you learn how to access the Azure Data Factory user experience (ADF UX) from the Azure portal. Once in the ADF UX, you configure three linked service for each of the data stores we're using: Azure SQL Database, ADLS Gen2, and Azure Synapse Analytics.

In Azure Data Factory linked services, define the connection information to external resources. Azure Data Factory currently supports over 85 connectors.

### Open the Azure Data Factory UX

1. Open the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) in either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.
1. Using the search bar at the top of the page, search for 'Data Factories'.
1. Select your data factory resource to open up its resources on the left hand pane.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/portal-data-factories.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of a data factories overview page.":::
1. Select **Open Azure Data Factory Studio**. The Data Factory Studio can also be accessed directly at adf.azure.com.

1. In the SQL Database configuration pane, enter 'SQLDB' as your linked service name. Enter in your credentials to allow data factory to connect to your database. If you're using SQL authentication, enter in the server name, the database, your user name and password. You can verify your connection information is correct by selecting **Test connection**. Select **Create** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-linked-service-azure-sql-database-configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of configuring a new Azure SQL Database linked service, with a successfully tested connection.":::

### Create an Azure Synapse Analytics linked service

1. Repeat the same process to add an Azure Synapse Analytics linked service. In the connections tab, select **New**. Select the **Azure Synapse Analytics** tile and select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-linked-service-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new Azure Synapse Analytics linked service.":::
1. In the linked service configuration pane, enter `SQLDW`` as your linked service name. Enter in your credentials to allow data factory to connect to your database. If you're using SQL authentication, enter in the server name, the database, your user name and password. You can verify your connection information is correct by selecting **Test connection**. Select **Create** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-linked-service-azure-synapse-analytics-configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of configuring a new Azure Synapse Analytics linked service named SQLDW.":::

### Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 linked service

1. The last linked service needed for this lab is an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.  In the connections tab, select **New**. Select the **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** tile and select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-linked-service-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new ADLS Gen2 linked service.":::

You can verify your connection information is correct by selecting **Test connection**. Select **Create** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-linked-service-azure-data-lake-storage-gen2-configure.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of configuring a new ADLS Gen2 linked service.":::

### Turn on data flow debug mode

In section *Transform data using mapping data flow*, you're building mapping data flows. A best practice before building mapping data flows is to turn on debug mode, which allows you to test transformation logic in seconds on an active spark cluster.

To turn on debug, select the **Data flow debug** slider in the top bar of data flow canvas or pipeline canvas when you have **Data flow** activities. Select **OK** when the confirmation dialog is shown. The cluster starts up in about 5 to 7 minutes. Continue on to *Ingest data from Azure SQL Database into ADLS Gen2 using the copy activity* while it's initializing.

:::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-data-flow-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Factory Resources pages, with the data flow debug button enabled.":::

:::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-data-flow-debug-completed.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where the Data flow debug slider is after an object is created." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-data-flow-debug-completed.png":::

## Ingest data using the copy activity

In this section, you create a pipeline with a copy activity that ingests one table from an Azure SQL Database into an ADLS Gen2 storage account. You learn how to add a pipeline, configure a dataset and debug a pipeline via the ADF UX. The configuration pattern used in this section can be applied to copying from a relational data store to a file-based data store.

In Azure Data Factory, a pipeline is a logical grouping of activities that together perform a task. An activity defines an operation to perform on your data. A dataset points to the data you wish to use in a linked service.

### Create a pipeline with a copy activity

1. In the factory resources pane, select on the plus icon to open the new resource menu. Select **Pipeline**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-new-pipeline.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new pipeline.":::
1. In the **General** tab of the pipeline canvas, name your pipeline something descriptive such as 'IngestAndTransformTaxiData'.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-ingest-and-transform-taxi-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of new Ingest and Transform Taxi data object." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-ingest-and-transform-taxi-data.png":::
1. In the activities pane of the pipeline canvas, open the **Move and Transform** accordion and drag the **Copy data** activity onto the canvas. Give the copy activity a descriptive name such as 'IngestIntoADLS'.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-copy-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of adding a copy data step." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/factory-resources-copy-data.png":::

### Configure Azure SQL DB source dataset

1. Select on the **Source** tab of the copy activity. To create a new dataset, select **New**. Your source will be the table `dbo.TripData` located in the linked service 'SQLDB' configured earlier.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/copy-data-source-dataset-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new dataset in the Copy Data source option.":::
1. Search for **Azure SQL Database** and select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-dataset-azure-sql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new dataset in Azure SQL Database.":::
1. Call your dataset 'TripData'. Select 'SQLDB' as your linked service. Select table name `dbo.TripData` from the table name dropdown list. Import the schema **From connection/store**. Select OK when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-dataset-azure-sql-database-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the properties page of creating a new dataset in Azure SQL Database.":::

You have successfully created your source dataset. Make sure in the source settings, the default value **Table** is selected in the use query field.

### Configure ADLS Gen2 sink dataset

1. Select on the **Sink** tab of the copy activity. To create a new dataset, select **New**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/copy-data-sink-dataset-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new dataset in the Copy Data sink option.":::
1. Search for **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** and select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-dataset-data-lake-storage-gen2.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new data in ADLS Gen2.":::
1. In the select format pane, select **DelimitedText** as you're writing to a csv file. Select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-dataset-data-lake-storage-gen2-format.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the format page when creating a new data in ADLS Gen2.":::
1. Name your sink dataset 'TripDataCSV'. Select 'ADLSGen2' as your linked service. Enter where you want to write your csv file. For example, you can write your data to file `trip-data.csv` in container `staging-container`. Set **First row as header** to true as you want your output data to have headers. Since no file exists in the destination yet, set **Import schema** to **None**. Select OK when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/new-dataset-data-lake-storage-gen2-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the properties page of creating a new data in ADLS Gen2.":::

### Test the copy activity with a pipeline debug run

1. To verify your copy activity is working correctly, select **Debug** at the top of the pipeline canvas to execute a debug run. A debug run allows you to test your pipeline either end-to-end or until a breakpoint before publishing it to the data factory service.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/debug-copy-data.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the debug button." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/debug-copy-data.png":::
1. To monitor your debug run, go to the **Output** tab of the pipeline canvas. The monitoring screen autorefreshes every 20 seconds or when you manually select the refresh button. The copy activity has a special monitoring view, which can be access by selecting the eye-glasses icon in the **Actions** column.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/debug-copy-data-monitoring.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the monitoring button.":::
1. The copy monitoring view gives the activity's execution details and performance characteristics. You can see information such as data read/written, rows read/written, files read/written, and throughput. If you configured everything correctly, you should see 49,999 rows written into one file in your ADLS sink.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/copy-monitoring-performance-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the performance details of the copy monitoring view." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/copy-monitoring-performance-details.png":::
1. Before moving on to the next section, it's suggested that you publish your changes to the data factory service by selecting **Publish all** in the factory top bar. While not covered in this lab, Azure Data Factory supports full git integration. Git integration allows for version control, iterative saving in a repository, and collaboration on a data factory. For more information, see [source control in Azure Data Factory](./source-control.md#troubleshooting-git-integration).

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/publish-all.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the publish all button.":::

## Transform data using mapping data flow

Now that you have successfully copied data into Azure Data Lake Storage, it's time to join and aggregate that data into a data warehouse. We use the mapping data flow, Azure Data Factory's visually designed transformation service. Mapping data flows allow users to develop transformation logic code-free and execute them on spark clusters managed by the ADF service.

The data flow created in this step inner joins the 'TripDataCSV' dataset created in the previous section with a table `dbo.TripFares` stored in 'SQLDB' based on four key columns. Then the data gets aggregated based upon column `payment_type` to calculate the average of certain fields and written in an Azure Synapse Analytics table.

### Add a data flow activity to your pipeline

1. In the activities pane of the pipeline canvas, open the **Move and Transform** accordion and drag the **Data flow** activity onto the canvas.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/move-transform-data-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the data flow option in the Move & Transform menu.":::
1. In the side pane that opens, select **Create new data flow** and choose **Mapping data flow**. Select **OK**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/adding-data-flow-mapping-data-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of adding a new mapping data flow." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/adding-data-flow-mapping-data-flow.png":::
1. You are directed to the data flow canvas where you are building your transformation logic. In the general tab, name your data flow 'JoinAndAggregateData'.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/join-and-aggregdate-data-flow.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Join And Aggregate Data flow." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/join-and-aggregdate-data-flow.png":::

### Configure your trip data CSV source

1. The first thing you want to do is configure your two source transformations. The first source points to the 'TripDataCSV' DelimitedText dataset. To add a source transformation, select on the **Add Source** box in the canvas.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-add-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the add source button in a new data flow.":::
1. Name your source 'TripDataCSV' and select the 'TripDataCSV' dataset from the source dropdown list. If you remember, you didn't import a schema initially when creating this dataset as there was no data there. Since `trip-data.csv` exists now, select **Edit** to go to the dataset settings tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-edit-source-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the edit source dataset button in the data flow options.":::
1. Go to tab **Schema** and select **Import schema**. Select **From connection/store** to import directly from the file store. 14 columns of type string should appear.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-schema-from-connection-store.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the schema source selection." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-schema-from-connection-store.png":::
1. Go back to data flow 'JoinAndAggregateData'. If your debug cluster has started (indicated by a green circle next to the debug slider), you can get a snapshot of the data in the **Data Preview** tab. Select **Refresh** to fetch a data preview.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-data-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the data flow preview." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-data-preview.png":::

> [!Note]
> Data preview does not write data.

### Configure your trip fares SQL Database source

1. The second source you're adding points at the SQL Database table `dbo.TripFares`. Under your 'TripDataCSV' source, there's another **Add Source** box. Select it to add a new source transformation.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-add-another-source.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of adding another data source to a data flow.":::
1. Name this source 'TripFaresSQL'. Select **New** next to the source dataset field to create a new SQL Database dataset.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-another-copy-data-source-dataset-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the new source dataset on another copy data step in the data flow.":::
1. Select the **Azure SQL Database** tile and select continue. You might notice many of the connectors in data factory aren't supported in mapping data flow. To transform data from one of these sources, ingest it into a supported source using the copy activity.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-new-dataset-azure-sql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of adding a new Azure SQL Database dataset to the data flow.":::
1. Call your dataset 'TripFares'. Select 'SQLDB' as your linked service. Select table name `dbo.TripFares` from the table name dropdown list. Import the schema **From connection/store**. Select OK when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-new-dataset-set-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the properties of adding a new Azure SQL Database dataset to the data flow.":::
1. To verify your data, fetch a data preview in the **Data Preview** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-another-source-data-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the data preview of another data source in the data flow." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-another-source-data-preview.png":::

### Inner join TripDataCSV and TripFaresSQL

1. To add a new transformation, select the plus icon in the bottom-right corner of 'TripDataCSV'. Under **Multiple inputs/outputs**, select **Join**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-join.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the join button in data sources in a data flow.":::
1. Name your join transformation 'InnerJoinWithTripFares'. Select 'TripFaresSQL' from the right stream dropdown list. Select **Inner** as the join type. To learn more about the different join types in mapping data flow, see [join types](./data-flow-join.md#join-types).

    Select which columns you wish to match on from each stream via the **Join conditions** dropdown list. To add an additional join condition, select on the plus icon next to an existing condition. By default, all join conditions are combined with an AND operator, which means all conditions must be met for a match. In this lab, we want to match on columns `medallion`, `hack_license`, `vendor_id`, and `pickup_datetime`

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-join-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of data flow join settings." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-join-settings.png":::
1. Verify you successfully joined 25 columns together with a data preview.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-join-data-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the data preview of a data flow with joined data sources." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-join-data-preview.png":::

### Aggregate by payment_type

1. After you complete your join transformation, add an aggregate transformation by selecting the plus icon next to **InnerJoinWithTripFares**. Choose **Aggregate** under **Schema modifier**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-new-aggregate.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the new aggregate button.":::
1. Name your aggregate transformation 'AggregateByPaymentType'. Select `payment_type` as the group by column.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-aggregate-settings.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of aggregate settings.":::
1. Go to the **Aggregates** tab. Specify two aggregations:
    * The average fare grouped by payment type
    * The total trip distance grouped by payment type

    First, you create the average fare expression. In the text box labeled **Add or select a column**, enter 'average_fare'.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-aggregate-settings-grouped-by.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Grouped by option in aggregate settings." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-aggregate-settings-grouped-by.png":::
1. To enter an aggregation expression, select the blue box labeled **Enter expression**, which opens up the data flow expression builder, a tool used to visually create data flow expressions using input schema, built-in functions and operations, and user-defined parameters. For more information on the capabilities of the expression builder, see the [expression builder documentation](./concepts-data-flow-expression-builder.md).

    To get the average fare, use the `avg()` aggregation function to aggregate the `total_amount` column cast to an integer with `toInteger()`. In the data flow expression language, this is defined as `avg(toInteger(total_amount))`. Select **Save and finish** when you're done.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/visual-expression-builder-aggregate.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Visual Expression Builder showing an aggregate function avg(toInteger(total_amount))." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/visual-expression-builder-aggregate.png":::
1. To add an extra aggregation expression, select on the plus icon next to `average_fare`. Select **Add column**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-settings-grouped-by-add-column.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the add column button in the aggregate settings grouped by option." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-settings-grouped-by-add-column.png":::
1. In the text box labeled **Add or select a column**, enter 'total_trip_distance'. As in the last step, open the expression builder to enter in the expression.

    To get the total trip distance, use the `sum()` aggregation function to aggregate the `trip_distance` column cast to an integer with `toInteger()`. In the data flow expression language, this is defined as `sum(toInteger(trip_distance))`. Select **Save and finish** when you're done.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-settings-grouped-by-two-columns.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of two columns in the aggregate settings grouped by option." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-settings-grouped-by-two-columns.png":::
1. Test your transformation logic in the **Data Preview** tab. As you can see, there are fewer rows and columns than previously. Only the three groups by and aggregation columns defined in this transformation continue downstream. As there are only five payment type groups in the sample, only five rows are outputted.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-data-preview.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of aggregate data preview." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/aggregate-data-preview.png":::

### Configure you Azure Synapse Analytics sink

1. Now that we have finished our transformation logic, we're ready to sink our data in an Azure Synapse Analytics table. Add a sink transformation under the **Destination** section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-add-sink.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the add sink button in the data flow." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-add-sink.png":::
1. Name your sink 'SQLDWSink'. Select **New** next to the sink dataset field to create a new Azure Synapse Analytics dataset.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-flow-add-sink-new-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of a new sink dataset button in the sink settings.":::

1. Select the **Azure Synapse Analytics** tile and select continue.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-sink-new-dataset-azure-synapse-analytics.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of a new Azure Synapse Analytics dataset for a new data sink.":::
1. Call your dataset 'AggregatedTaxiData'. Select 'SQLDW' as your linked service. Select **Create new table** and name the new table `dbo.AggregateTaxiData`. Select **OK** when finished.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-sink-set-properties-create-new-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of creating a new table for the data sink.":::
1. Go to the **Settings** tab of the sink. Since we're creating a new table, we need to select **Recreate table** under table action. Unselect **Enable staging**, which toggles whether we're inserting row-by-row or in batch.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-sink-settings-recreate-table.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of data sink settings, the Recreate table option." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-sink-settings-recreate-table.png":::

You have successfully created your data flow. Now it's time to run it in a pipeline activity.

### Debug your pipeline end-to-end

1. Go back to the tab for the **IngestAndTransformData** pipeline. Notice the green box on the 'IngestIntoADLS' copy activity. Drag it over to the 'JoinAndAggregateData' data flow activity. This creates an 'on success', which causes the data flow activity to only run if the copy is successful.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/pipeline-on-success.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of a green success pipeline.":::
1. As we did for the copy activity, select **Debug** to execute a debug run. For debug runs, the data flow activity uses the active debug cluster instead of spinning up a new cluster. This pipeline takes a little over a minute to execute.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/pipeline-on-success-data-flow-debug.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the data flow debug button for the on success pipeline." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/pipeline-on-success-data-flow-debug.png":::
1. Like the copy activity, the data flow has a special monitoring view accessed by the eyeglasses icon on completion of the activity.

You have now completed the data factory portion of this lab. Publish your resources if you wish to operationalize them with triggers. You successfully ran a pipeline that ingested data from Azure SQL Database to Azure Data Lake Storage using the copy activity and then aggregated that data into an Azure Synapse Analytics. You can verify the data was successfully written by looking at the SQL Server itself.

## Share data using Azure Data Share

In this section, you learn how to set up a new data share using the Azure portal. This involves creating a new data share that contains datasets from Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 and Azure Synapse Analytics. You'll then configure a snapshot schedule, which will give the data consumers an option to automatically refresh the data being shared with them. Then, you'll invite recipients to your data share. 

Once you have created a data share, you'll then switch hats and become the *data consumer*. As the data consumer, you'll walk through the flow of accepting a data share invitation, configuring where you'd like the data to be received and mapping datasets to different storage locations. Then, you'll trigger a snapshot, which will copy the data shared with you into the destination specified. 

### Share data (Data Provider flow)

1. Open the Azure portal in either Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome.

1. Using the search bar at the top of the page, search for **Data Shares**

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/portal-search-data-shares.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of searching for data shares in the Azure portal search bar.":::

1. Select the data share account with 'Provider' in the name. For example, **DataProvider0102**. 

1. Select **Start sharing your data**

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-share-start-sharing.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the start sharing your data button." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/data-share-start-sharing.png":::

1. Select **+Create** to start configuring your new data share. 

1. Under **Share name**, specify a name of your choice. This is the share name that will be seen by your data consumer, so be sure to give it a descriptive name such as TaxiData.

1. Under **Description**, put in a sentence, which describes the contents of the data share. The data share contains world-wide taxi trip data that is stored in a variety of stores, including Azure Synapse Analytics and Azure Data Lake Storage. 

1. Under **Terms of use**, specify a set of terms that you would like your data consumer to adhere to. Some examples include "Do not distribute this data outside your organization" or "Refer to legal agreement". 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/details.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Data Share details in Sent Shares." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/details.png":::

1. Select **Continue**. 

1. Select **Add datasets** 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-dataset.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Add dataset button in the Data Share in Sent Shares." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-dataset.png":::

1. Select **Azure Synapse Analytics** to select a table from Azure Synapse Analytics that your ADF transformations landed in.
1. You are given a script to run before you can proceed. The script provided creates a user in the SQL database to allow the Azure Data Share MSI to authenticate on its behalf. 

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before running the script, you must set yourself as the Active Directory Admin for the logical SQL server of the Azure SQL Database. 
    
1. Open a new tab and navigate to the Azure portal. Copy the script provided to create a user in the database that you want to share data from. Do this by signing in to the EDW database using the [Azure portal Query editor](/azure/azure-sql/database/query-editor), using Microsoft Entra authentication. You need to modify the user in the following sample script:

    ```sql
    CREATE USER [dataprovider-xxxx@contoso.com] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER; 
    ALTER ROLE db_owner ADD MEMBER [wiassaf@microsoft.com];
    ```
    
1. Switch back to Azure Data Share where you were adding datasets to your data share. 

1. Select **EDW**, then select **AggregatedTaxiData** for the table. 

1. Select **Add dataset**

    We now have a SQL table that is part of our dataset. Next, we will add additional datasets from Azure Data Lake Storage. 

1. Select **Add dataset** and select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2**

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-dataset-adls.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of add an ADLS Gen2 dataset." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-dataset-adls.png":::

1. Select **Next**

1. Expand **wwtaxidata**. Expand **Boston Taxi Data**. You can share down to the file level. 

1. Select the **Boston Taxi Data** folder to add the entire folder to your data share. 

1. Select **Add datasets**

1. Review the datasets that have been added. You should have a SQL table and an ADLS Gen2 folder added to your data share. 

1. Select **Continue**

1. In this screen, you can add recipients to your data share. The recipients you add will receive invitations to your data share. For the purpose of this lab, you must add in two e-mail addresses:

    1. The e-mail address of the Azure subscription you're in. 

        :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-recipients.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the Data Share add recipients." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/add-recipients.png":::

    1. Add in the fictional data consumer named *janedoe@fabrikam.com*.

1. In this screen, you can configure a Snapshot Setting for your data consumer. This allows them to receive regular updates of your data at an interval defined by you. 

1. Check **Snapshot Schedule** and configure an hourly refresh of your data by using the *Recurrence* dropdown list.  

1. Select **Create**.

    You now have an active data share. Lets review what you can see as a data provider when you create a data share. 

1. Select the data share that you created, titled **DataProvider**. You can navigate to it by selecting **Sent Shares** in **Data Share**. 

1. Select on Snapshot schedule. You can disable the snapshot schedule if you choose. 

1. Next, select the **Datasets** tab. You can add additional datasets to this data share after it has been created. 

1. Select the **Share subscriptions** tab. No share subscriptions exist yet because your data consumer hasn't yet accepted your invitation.

1. Navigate to the **Invitations** tab. Here, you'll see a list of pending invitation(s). 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/pending-invites.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of Pending invitations." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/pending-invites.png":::

1. Select the invitation to *janedoe@fabrikam.com*. Select Delete. If your recipient hasn't yet accepted the invitation, they will no longer be able to do so. 

1. Select the **History** tab. Nothing is displayed as yet because your data consumer hasn't yet accepted your invitation and triggered a snapshot. 

### Receive data (Data consumer flow)

Now that we have reviewed our data share, we are ready to switch context and wear our data consumer hat. 

You should now have an Azure Data Share invitation in your inbox from Microsoft Azure. Launch Outlook Web Access (outlook.com) and sign in using the credentials supplied for your Azure subscription.

In the e-mail that you should have received, select on "View invitation >". At this point, you're going to be simulating the data consumer experience when accepting a data providers invitation to their data share. 

:::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/email-invite.png" alt-text="Screenshot from Outlook of an Email invitation." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/email-invite.png":::

You might be prompted to select a subscription. Make sure you select the subscription you have been working in for this lab. 

1. Select on the invitation titled *DataProvider*. 

1. In this **Invitation** screen, notice various details about the data share that you configured earlier as a data provider. Review the details and accept the terms of use if provided.

1. Select the Subscription and Resource Group that already exists for your lab. 

1. For **Data share account**, select **DataConsumer**. You can also create a new data share account. 

1. Next to **Received share name**, notice the default share name is the name that was specified by the data provider. Give the share a friendly name that describes the data you're about to receive, e.g **TaxiDataShare**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/consumer-accept.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the page to Accept and Configure a data share." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/consumer-accept.png":::

1. You can choose to **Accept and configure now** or **Accept and configure later**. If you choose to accept and configure now, specify a storage account where all data should be copied. If you choose to accept and configure later, the datasets in the share will be unmapped and you'll need to manually map them. We will opt for that later. 

1. Select **Accept and configure later**. 

    When configuring this option, a share subscription is created but there is nowhere for the data to land since no destination has been mapped. 

    Next, configure dataset mappings for the data share. 

1. Select the Received Share (the name you specified in step 5).

    **Trigger snapshot** is greyed out but the share is Active. 

1. Select the **Datasets** tab. Each dataset is Unmapped, which means that it has no destination to copy data to. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/unmapped.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of unmapped datasets." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/unmapped.png":::

1. Select the Azure Synapse Analytics Table and then select **+ Map to Target**.

1. On the right-hand side of the screen, select the **Target Data Type** dropdown list. 

    You can map the SQL data to a wide range of data stores. In this case, we'll be mapping to an Azure SQL Database.

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/mapping-options.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of map datasets to target." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/mapping-options.png":::
    
    (Optional) Select **Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2** as the target data type. 
    
    (Optional) Select the Subscription, Resource Group and Storage account you have been working in. 
    
    (Optional) You can choose to receive the data into your data lake in either csv or parquet format. 

1. Next to **Target data type**, select Azure SQL Database. 

1. Select the Subscription, Resource Group and Storage account you have been working in. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/map-datasets-to-target-azure-sql-database.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of map datasets to a target Azure SQL Database." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/map-datasets-to-target-azure-sql-database.png":::

1. Before you can proceed, you'll need to create a new user in the SQL Server by running the script provided. First, copy the script provided to your clipboard. 

1. Open a new Azure portal tab. Don't close your existing tab as you'll need to come back to it in a moment. 

1. In the new tab you opened, navigate to **SQL databases**.

1. Select the SQL database (there should only be one in your subscription). Be careful not to select the data warehouse. 

1. Select **Query editor (preview)**

1. Use Microsoft Entra authentication to sign in to the Query editor. 

1. Run the query provided in your data share (copied to clipboard in step 14). 

    This command allows the Azure Data Share service to use Managed Identities for Azure Services to authenticate to the SQL Server to be able to copy data into it. 

1. Go back to the original tab, and select **Map to target**.

1. Next, select the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 folder that is part of the dataset and map it to an Azure Blob Storage account. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/map-datasets-to-target-azure-blob-storage.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of map datasets to a target Azure Blob Storage." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/map-datasets-to-target-azure-blob-storage.png":::

    With all datasets mapped, you're now ready to start receiving data from the data provider. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/all-mapped.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of received shares mapped." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/all-mapped.png":::
    
1. Select **Details**. 

    **Trigger snapshot** is no longer greyed out, since the data share now has destinations to copy into.

1. Select **Trigger snapshot** -> **Full copy**. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/trigger-full.png" alt-text="Screenshot from the Azure portal of the trigger snapshot, full copy option." lightbox="media/lab-data-flow-data-share/trigger-full.png":::

    This starts copying data into your new data share account. In a real world scenario, this data would be coming from a third party. 

    It takes approximately 3-5 minutes for the data to come across. You can monitor progress by selecting on the **History** tab. 

    While you wait, navigate to the original data share (DataProvider) and view the status of the **Share Subscriptions** and **History** tab. There is now an active subscription, and as a data provider, you can also monitor when the data consumer has started to receive the data shared with them. 

1. Navigate back to the data consumer's data share. Once the status of the trigger is successful, navigate to the destination SQL database and data lake to see that the data has landed in the respective stores. 

Congratulations, you have completed the lab!
