# Prepare your Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

An Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster is a prerequisite for deploying Azure IoT Operations Preview. This article describes how to prepare a cluster before you deploy Azure IoT Operations. This article includes guidance for both Ubuntu and Windows.

The steps in this article prepare your cluster for a secure settings deployment, which is a longer but production-ready process. If you want to deploy Azure IoT Operations quickly and run a sample workload with only test settings, see the [Quickstart: Run Azure IoT Operations Preview in GitHub Codespaces with K3s](../get-started-end-to-end-sample/quickstart-deploy.md) instead. For more information about test settings and secure settings, see [Deployment details > Choose your features](./overview-deploy.md#choose-your-features).

## Prerequisites

Microsoft supports Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Edge Essentials for deployments on Windows and K3s for deployments on Ubuntu. For a list of specific hardware and software combinations that are tested and validated, see [Validated environments](../overview-iot-operations.md#validated-environments).

If you want to deploy Azure IoT Operations to a multi-node solution, use K3s on Ubuntu.

### [Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu)

To prepare an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* Azure CLI version 2.64.0 or newer installed on your development machine. Use `az --version` to check your version and `az upgrade` to update if necessary. For more information, see [How to install the Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

* The latest version of the following extensions for Azure CLI:

  ```bash
  az extension add --upgrade --name azure-iot-ops
  az extension add --upgrade --name connectedk8s
  ```

* Hardware that meets the system requirements:

  * Ensure that your machine has a minimum of 16-GB available RAM and 8 available vCPUs reserved for Azure IoT Operations.
  * [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes system requirements](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/system-requirements).
  * [K3s requirements](https://docs.k3s.io/installation/requirements).

* If you're going to deploy Azure IoT Operations to a multi-node cluster with fault tolerance enabled, review the hardware and storage requirements in [Prepare Linux for Edge Volumes](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/prepare-linux-edge-volumes).

### [AKS Edge Essentials](#tab/aks-edge-essentials)

To prepare an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you need:

* An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

* Hardware that meets the system requirements:

  * Ensure that your machine has a minimum of 16-GB available RAM, 8 available vCPUs, and 52-GB free disk space reserved for Azure IoT Operations.
  * [Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes system requirements](/azure/azure-arc/kubernetes/system-requirements).

## Create and Arc-enable a cluster

This section provides steps to create clusters in validated environments on Linux and Windows.

### [Ubuntu](#tab/ubuntu)

To prepare a K3s Kubernetes cluster on Ubuntu:

1. Install K3s following the instructions in the [K3s quick-start guide](https://docs.k3s.io/quick-start).

1. Check to see that kubectl was installed as part of K3s. If not, follow the instructions to [Install kubectl on Linux](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-linux/).

   ```bash
   kubectl version --client
   ```

1. Follow the instructions to [Install Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/).

1. Create a K3s configuration yaml file in `.kube/config`:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/.kube
   sudo KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config:/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml kubectl config view --flatten > ~/.kube/merged
   mv ~/.kube/merged ~/.kube/config
   chmod  0600 ~/.kube/config
   export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config
   #switch to k3s context
   kubectl config use-context default
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml
   ```

1. Run the following command to increase the [user watch/instance limits](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020048).

   ```bash
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_instances=8192 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
   echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

1. For better performance, increase the file descriptor limit:

   ```bash
   echo fs.file-max = 100000 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf

   sudo sysctl -p
   ```

### Configure multi-node clusters for Azure Container Storage

On multi-node clusters with at least three nodes, you have the option of enabling fault tolerance for storage with [Azure Container Storage enabled by Azure Arc](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/overview) when you deploy Azure IoT Operations. 

If you want to enable fault tolerance during deployment, configure your clusters by following the steps in [Prepare Linux for Edge Volumes using a multi-node Ubuntu cluster](/azure/azure-arc/container-storage/multi-node-cluster-edge-volumes?pivots=ubuntu).

### Arc-enable your cluster

Connect your cluster to Azure Arc so that it can be managed remotely.

1. On the machine where you deployed the Kubernetes cluster, sign in with Azure CLI:

   ```azurecli
   az login
   ```

   If at any point you get an error that says *Your device is required to be managed to access your resource*, run `az login` again and make sure that you sign in interactively with a browser.

1. After you sign in, the Azure CLI displays all of your subscriptions and indicates your default subscription with an asterisk `*`. To continue with your default subscription, select `Enter`. Otherwise, type the number of the Azure subscription that you want to use.

1. Register the required resource providers in your subscription.

   >[!NOTE]
   >This step only needs to be run once per subscription. To register resource providers, you need permission to do the `/register/action` operation, which is included in subscription Contributor and Owner roles. For more information, see [Azure resource providers and types](../../azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types.md).

   ```azurecli
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.ExtendedLocation"
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.Kubernetes"
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.KubernetesConfiguration"
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.IoTOperations"
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.DeviceRegistry"
   az provider register -n "Microsoft.SecretSyncController"
   ```

1. Use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a resource group in your Azure subscription to store all the resources:

   For the list of currently supported Azure regions, see [Supported regions](../overview-iot-operations.md#supported-regions).

   ```azurecli
   az group create --location <REGION> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID>
   ```

1. Use the [az connectedk8s connect](/cli/azure/connectedk8s#az-connectedk8s-connect) command to Arc-enable your Kubernetes cluster and manage it as part of your Azure resource group.

   ```azurecli
   az connectedk8s connect --name <CLUSTER_NAME> -l <REGION> --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --subscription <SUBSCRIPTION_ID> --enable-oidc-issuer --enable-workload-identity
   ```

1. Get the cluster's issuer URL.

   ```azurecli
   az connectedk8s show --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --name <CLUSTER_NAME> --query oidcIssuerProfile.issuerUrl --output tsv
   ```

   Save the output of this command to use in the next steps.

1. Create a k3s config file.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/rancher/k3s/config.yaml
   ```

1. Add the following content to the `config.yaml` file, replacing the `<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER>` placeholder with your cluster's issuer URL.

   ```yml
   kube-apiserver-arg:
    - service-account-issuer=<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_ISSUER>
    - service-account-max-token-expiration=24h
   ```

1. Save the file and exit the nano editor.

1. Get the `objectId` of the Microsoft Entra ID application that the Azure Arc service uses in your tenant and save it as an environment variable. Run the following command exactly as written, without changing the GUID value.

   ```azurecli
   export OBJECT_ID=$(az ad sp show --id bc313c14-388c-4e7d-a58e-70017303ee3b --query id -o tsv)
   ```

1. Use the [az connectedk8s enable-features](/cli/azure/connectedk8s#az-connectedk8s-enable-features) command to enable custom location support on your cluster. This command uses the `objectId` of the Microsoft Entra ID application that the Azure Arc service uses. Run this command on the machine where you deployed the Kubernetes cluster:

   ```azurecli
   az connectedk8s enable-features -n <CLUSTER_NAME> -g <RESOURCE_GROUP> --custom-locations-oid $OBJECT_ID --features cluster-connect custom-locations
   ```

1. Restart K3s.

   ```bash
   systemctl restart k3s
   ```

### [AKS Edge Essentials](#tab/aks-edge-essentials)

[Azure Kubernetes Service Edge Essentials](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-overview) is an on-premises Kubernetes implementation of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) that automates running containerized applications at scale. AKS Edge Essentials includes a Microsoft-supported Kubernetes platform that includes a lightweight Kubernetes distribution with a small footprint and simple installation experience that supports PC-class or "light" edge hardware.

The [AksEdgeQuickStartForAio.ps1](https://github.com/Azure/AKS-Edge/blob/main/tools/scripts/AksEdgeQuickStart/AksEdgeQuickStartForAio.ps1) script automates the process of creating and connecting a cluster, and is the recommended path for deploying Azure IoT Operations on AKS Edge Essentials.

For instructions on running the script, see [Configure an AKS Edge Essentials cluster for Azure IoT Operations](/azure/aks/hybrid/aks-edge-howto-deploy-azure-iot).

---

## Verify your cluster

To verify that your cluster is ready for Azure IoT Operations deployment, you can use the [verify-host](/cli/azure/iot/ops#az-iot-ops-verify-host) helper command in the Azure IoT Operations extension for Azure CLI. When run on the cluster host, this helper command checks connectivity to Azure Resource Manager and Microsoft Container Registry endpoints.

```azurecli
az iot ops verify-host
```

## Advanced configuration

At this point, when you have an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster but before you deploy Azure IoT Operations to it, you might want to configure your cluster for advanced scenarios.

* If you want to enable observability features on the cluster, follow the steps in [Deploy observability resources and set up logs](../configure-observability-monitoring/howto-configure-observability.md).
* If you want to configure your own certificate issuer on the cluster, follow the steps in [Certificate management > Bring your own issuer](../secure-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca.md#bring-your-own-issuer).

## Next steps

Now that you have an Azure Arc-enabled Kubernetes cluster, you can [deploy Azure IoT Operations](howto-deploy-iot-operations.md).
