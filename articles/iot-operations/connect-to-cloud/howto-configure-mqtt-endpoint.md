# Configure MQTT dataflow endpoints

[!INCLUDE [public-preview-note](../includes/public-preview-note.md)]

MQTT dataflow endpoints are used for MQTT sources and destinations. You can configure the endpoint settings, Transport Layer Security (TLS), authentication, and other settings.

## Prerequisites

- An instance of [Azure IoT Operations Preview](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-deploy-iot-operations.md)
- A [configured dataflow profile](howto-configure-dataflow-profile.md)

## Azure IoT Operations local MQTT broker

Azure IoT Operations provides a [built-in local MQTT broker](../manage-mqtt-broker/overview-iot-mq.md) that you can use with dataflows. You can use the MQTT broker as a source to receive messages from other systems or as a destination to send messages to other systems.

### Default endpoint

When you deploy Azure IoT Operations, an MQTT broker dataflow endpoint named "default" is created with default settings. You can use this endpoint as a source or destination for dataflows. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The default endpoint **must always be used as either the source or destination in every dataflow**. To learn more about, see [Dataflows must use local MQTT broker endpoint](./howto-configure-dataflow-endpoint.md#dataflows-must-use-local-mqtt-broker-endpoint).

The default endpoint uses the following settings:

- Host: `aio-broker:18883` through the [default MQTT broker listener](../manage-mqtt-broker/howto-configure-brokerlistener.md#default-brokerlistener)
- Authentication: service account token (SAT) through the [default BrokerAuthentication resource](../manage-mqtt-broker/howto-configure-authentication.md#default-brokerauthentication-resource)
- TLS: Enabled
- Trusted CA certificate: The default CA certificate `azure-iot-operations-aio-ca-trust-bundle` from the [default root CA](../deploy-iot-ops/concept-default-root-ca.md)

> [!CAUTION]
> Don't delete the default endpoint. If you delete the default endpoint, you must recreate it with the same settings.

To view or edit the default MQTT broker endpoint settings:

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com/), select the **Dataflow endpoints**.
1. Select the **default** endpoint to view or edit the settings.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-mqtt-endpoint/default-mqtt-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot using operations experience to view the default MQTT dataflow endpoint.":::

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

To edit the default endpoint, create a Bicep `.bicep` file with the following content. Update the settings as needed, and replace the placeholder values like `<AIO_INSTANCE_NAME>` with your own.

```bicep
param aioInstanceName string = '<AIO_INSTANCE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'

resource aioInstance 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances@2024-09-15-preview' existing = {
  name: aioInstanceName
}
resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}
resource defaultMqttBrokerDataflowEndpoint 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/dataflowEndpoints@2024-09-15-preview' = {
  parent: aioInstance
  name: 'default'
  extendedLocation: {
    name: customLocation.id
    type: 'CustomLocation'
  }
  properties: {
    endpointType: 'Mqtt'
    mqttSettings: {
      host: 'aio-broker:18883'
      authentication: {
        method: 'ServiceAccountToken'
        serviceAccountTokenSettings: {
          audience: 'aio-internal'
        }
      }
      tls: {
        mode: 'Enabled'
        trustedCaCertificateConfigMapRef: 'azure-iot-operations-aio-ca-trust-bundle'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, deploy via Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file <FILE>.bicep
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

You can view the default MQTT broker endpoint settings in the Kubernetes cluster. To view the settings, use the following command:

```bash
kubectl get dataflowendpoint default -n azure-iot-operations -o yaml
```

---

### Create new endpoint

You can also create new local MQTT broker endpoints with custom settings. For example, you can create a new MQTT broker endpoint using a different port, authentication, or authorization settings. However, you must still always use the default endpoint as either the source or destination in every dataflow, even if you create new endpoints.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com/), select the **Dataflow endpoints**.
1. Under **Create new dataflow endpoint**, select **Azure IoT Operations Local MQTT** > **New**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-mqtt-endpoint/local-mqtt-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot using operations experience to create a new local MQTT dataflow endpoint.":::

    Enter the following settings for the endpoint:

    | Setting              | Description                                                                                       |

## Azure Event Grid

[Azure Event Grid provides a fully managed MQTT broker](../../event-grid/mqtt-overview.md) that works with Azure IoT Operations dataflows. To configure an Azure Event Grid MQTT broker endpoint, we recommend that you use managed identity for authentication.

### Configure Event Grid namespace

If you haven't done so already, [create Event Grid namespace](../../event-grid/create-view-manage-namespaces.md) first.

#### Enable MQTT

Once you have an Event Grid namespace, go to **Configuration** and check:

- **Enable MQTT**: Select the checkbox.
- **Maximum client sessions per authentication name**: Set to **3** or more.

The max client sessions option is important so that dataflows can [scale up](howto-configure-dataflow-profile.md) and still be able to connect. To learn more, see [Event Grid MQTT multi-session support](../../event-grid/mqtt-establishing-multiple-sessions-per-client.md).

#### Create a topic space

In order for dataflows to send or receive messages to Event Grid MQTT broker, you need to create at least one topic space in the Event Grid namespace. You can create a topic space in the Event Grid namespace by selecting **Topic spaces** > **New topic space**. 

To quickly get started and for testing, you can create a topic space with the wildcard topic `#` as the topic template.

#### Assign permission to managed identity

Now that the topic space is created, you need to assign the managed identity of the Azure IoT Operations Arc extension to the Event Grid namespace or topic space.

<!-- TODO: refactor or make the get managed identity / extension name an include? -->

In Azure portal, go to the Arc-connected Kubernetes cluster and select **Settings** > **Extensions**. In the extension list, find the name of your Azure IoT Operations extension. Copy the name of the extension.

Then, go to the Event Grid namespace > **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**. Assign the managed identity of the Azure IoT Operations Arc extension with an appropriate role like `EventGrid TopicSpaces Publisher` or `EventGrid TopicSpaces Subscriber`. This gives the managed identity the necessary permissions to send or receive messages for all topic spaces in the namespace. 

Alternatively, you can assign the role at the topic space level. Go to the topic space > **Access control (IAM)** > **Add role assignment**. Assign the managed identity of the Azure IoT Operations Arc extension with an appropriate role like `EventGrid TopicSpaces Publisher` or `EventGrid TopicSpaces Subscriber`. This gives the managed identity the necessary permissions to send or receive messages for the specific topic space.

### Create dataflow endpoint

Once the Event Grid namespace is configured, you can create a dataflow endpoint for the Event Grid MQTT broker.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com/), select the **Dataflow endpoints** tab.
1. Under **Create new dataflow endpoint**, select **Azure Event Grid MQTT** > **New**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-mqtt-endpoint/event-grid-endpoint.png" alt-text="Screenshot using operations experience to create an Azure Event Grid endpoint.":::

    Enter the following settings for the endpoint:

    | Setting              | Description                                                                                       |
    | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Name                 | The name of the dataflow endpoint.                                                        |
    | Host                 | The hostname and port of the Event Grid MQTT broker. Use the format `<NAMESPACE>.<REGION>-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net:8883`                                |
    | Authentication method | The method used for authentication. Choose *System assigned managed identity* |

1. Select **Apply** to provision the endpoint.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Create a Bicep `.bicep` file with the following content.

```bicep
param aioInstanceName string = '<AIO_INSTANCE_NAME>'
param customLocationName string = '<CUSTOM_LOCATION_NAME>'
param endpointName string = '<ENDPOINT_NAME>'
param eventGridHostName string = '<NAMESPACE>.<REGION>-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net:8883'

resource aioInstance 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances@2024-09-15-preview' existing = {
  name: aioInstanceName
}
resource customLocation 'Microsoft.ExtendedLocation/customLocations@2021-08-31-preview' existing = {
  name: customLocationName
}
resource remoteMqttBrokerDataflowEndpoint 'Microsoft.IoTOperations/instances/dataflowEndpoints@2024-09-15-preview' = {
  parent: aioInstance
  name: endpointName
  extendedLocation: {
    name: customLocation.id
    type: 'CustomLocation'
  }
  properties: {
    endpointType: 'Mqtt'
    mqttSettings: {
      host: eventGridHostName
      authentication: {
        method: 'SystemAssignedManagedIdentity'
        systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings: {}
      }
      tls: {
        mode: 'Enabled'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then, deploy via Azure CLI.

```azurecli
az deployment group create --resource-group <RESOURCE_GROUP> --template-file <FILE>.bicep
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

Create a Kubernetes manifest `.yaml` file with the following content.

```yaml
apiVersion: connectivity.iotoperations.azure.com/v1beta1
kind: DataflowEndpoint
metadata:
  name: <ENDPOINT_NAME>
  namespace: azure-iot-operations
spec:
  endpointType: Mqtt
  mqttSettings:
    host: <NAMESPACE>.<REGION>-1.ts.eventgrid.azure.net:8883
    authentication:
      method: SystemAssignedManagedIdentity
      systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings:
        {}
    tls:
      mode: Enabled
```

Then apply the manifest file to the Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f <FILE>.yaml
```

---

Once the endpoint is created, you can use it in a dataflow to connect to the Event Grid MQTT broker as a source or destination. The MQTT topics are configured in the dataflow.

### Use X.509 certificate authentication with Event Grid

We recommended using managed identity for authentication. You can also use X.509 certificate authentication with the Event Grid MQTT broker.

When you use X.509 authentication with an Event Grid MQTT broker, go to the Event Grid namespace > **Configuration** and check these settings:

- **Enable MQTT**: Select the checkbox.
- **Enable alternative client authentication name sources**: Select the checkbox.
- **Certificate Subject Name**: Select this option in the dropdown list.
- **Maximum client sessions per authentication name**: Set to **3** or more.

The alternative client authentication and maximum client sessions options allow dataflows to use client certificate subject name for authentication instead of `MQTT CONNECT Username`. This capability is important so that dataflows can spawn multiple instances and still be able to connect. To learn more, see [Event Grid MQTT client certificate authentication](../../event-grid/mqtt-client-certificate-authentication.md) and [Multi-session support](../../event-grid/mqtt-establishing-multiple-sessions-per-client.md).

Then, follow the steps in [X.509 certificate](#x509-certificate) to configure the endpoint with the X.509 certificate settings.

### Event Grid shared subscription limitation

Azure Event Grid MQTT broker [doesn't support shared subscriptions](../../event-grid/mqtt-support.md#mqttv5-current-limitations), which means that you can't set the `instanceCount` to more than `1` in the dataflow profile if Event Grid is used as a source (where the dataflow subscribes to messages) for a dataflow. In this case, if you set `instanceCount` greater than `1`, the dataflow fails to start.

## Custom MQTT brokers

For other MQTT brokers, you can configure the endpoint, TLS, authentication, and other settings as needed.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

1. In the [operations experience](https://iotoperations.azure.com/), select the **Dataflow endpoints** tab.
1. Under **Create new dataflow endpoint**, select **Custom MQTT Broker** > **New**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/howto-configure-mqtt-endpoint/custom-mqtt-broker.png" alt-text="Screenshot using operations experience to create a custom MQTT broker endpoint.":::

1. Enter the following settings for the endpoint:

    | Setting               | Description                                                                                       |
    | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Name                  | The name of the dataflow endpoint                                                                 |
    | Host                  | The hostname of the MQTT broker endpoint in the format `<hostname>.<port>`. |
    | Authentication method | The method used for authentication. Choose *System assigned managed identity*, *User assigned managed identity*, or *Service account token*. |
    | Service audience      | The audience for the service account token. Required if using service account token. |
    | Client ID             | The client ID of the user-assigned managed identity. Required if using *User assigned managed identity*. |
    | Tenant ID             | The tenant ID of the user-assigned managed identity. Required if using *User assigned managed identity*. |
    | Access token secret name | The name of the Kubernetes secret containing the SAS token. Required if using *Access token*. |

1. Select **Apply** to provision the endpoint.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    // See available authentication methods below
  }
  host: '<HOST>:<PORT>'
  tls: {
    mode: 'Enabled' // or 'Disabled'
    trustedCaCertificateConfigMapRef: '<TRUSTED_CA_CERT_CONFIGMAP>'
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
spec:
  endpointType: Mqtt
  mqttSettings:
    host: <HOST>:<PORT>
    authentication:
      # See available authentication methods below
    tls:
      mode: Enabled # or Disabled
      trustedCaCertificateConfigMapRef: <TRUSTED_CA_CERT_CONFIGMAP>
```

---

To customize the MQTT endpoint settings, see the following sections for more information.

## Available authentication methods

The following authentication methods are available for MQTT broker dataflow endpoints. For more information about enabling secure settings by configuring an Azure Key Vault and enabling workload identities, see [Enable secure settings in Azure IoT Operations Preview deployment](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-enable-secure-settings.md).

### X.509 certificate

Many MQTT brokers, like Event Grid, support X.509 authentication. Dataflows can present a client X.509 certificate and negotiate the TLS communication. 

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Basic** tab then choose **Authentication method** > **X509 certificate**.

Enter the following settings for the endpoint:

| Setting               | Description                                                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| X509 client certificate | The X.509 client certificate used for authentication. |
| X509 intermediate certificates | The intermediate certificates for the X.509 client certificate chain.  |
| X509 client key       | The private key corresponding to the X.509 client certificate. |

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    method: 'X509Certificate'
      x509CertificateSettings:
        secretRef: '<X509_SECRET_NAME>'
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

To use X.509 certificate authentication, you need to create a secret with the certificate and private key. Use the Kubernetes TLS secret containing the public certificate and private key. For example:

```bash
kubectl create secret tls my-tls-secret -n azure-iot-operations \
  --cert=path/to/cert/file \
  --key=path/to/key/file
```

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: X509Certificate
    x509CertificateSettings:
      secretRef: <X509_SECRET_NAME>
```

---

### System-assigned managed identity

To use system-assigned managed identity for authentication, you don't need to create a secret. The system-assigned managed identity is used to authenticate with the MQTT broker. 

Before you configure the endpoint, make sure that the Azure IoT Operations managed identity has the necessary permissions to connect to the MQTT broker. 

1. In Azure portal, go to your Azure IoT Operations instance and select **Overview**.
1. Copy the name of the extension listed after **Azure IoT Operations Arc extension**. For example, *azure-iot-operations-xxxx7*.
1. Search for the managed identity in the Azure portal by using the name of the extension. For example, search for *azure-iot-operations-xxxx7*.
1. Assign a role to the Azure IoT Operations Arc extension managed identity that grants permission to connect to the MQTT broker. For example, with Azure Event Grid MQTT broker, assign the managed identity to the Event Grid namespace or topic space with [an appropriate role](../../event-grid/mqtt-client-microsoft-entra-token-and-rbac.md#authorization-to-grant-access-permissions).
1. Configure the endpoint with system-assigned managed identity settings.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Basic** tab then choose **Authentication method** > **System assigned managed identity**.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)


```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    method: 'SystemAssignedManagedIdentity'
    systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings: {}
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: SystemAssignedManagedIdentity
    systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings:
      {}
```

---

In most cases when using with Event Grid, you can leave the settings empty as shown. This sets the managed identity audience to the Event Grid common audience `https://eventgrid.azure.net`. If you need to set a different audience, you can specify it in the settings.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

Not supported.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    method: 'SystemAssignedManagedIdentity'
    systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings: {
      audience: 'https://<AUDIENCE>'
    }
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: SystemAssignedManagedIdentity
    systemAssignedManagedIdentitySettings:
      audience: https://<AUDIENCE>
```

---

### User-assigned managed identity

To use user-managed identity for authentication, you must first deploy Azure IoT Operations with secure settings enabled. To learn more, see [Enable secure settings in Azure IoT Operations Preview deployment](../deploy-iot-ops/howto-enable-secure-settings.md).

Then, specify the user-assigned managed identity authentication method along with the client ID and tenant ID of the managed identity.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Basic** tab then choose **Authentication method** > **User assigned managed identity**.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    method: 'UserAssignedManagedIdentity'
    userAssignedManagedIdentitySettings: {
      cliendId: '<ID>'
      tenantId: '<ID>'
      // Optional, defaults to 'https://eventgrid.azure.net/.default'
      // scope: 'https://<SCOPE_URL>' 
    }
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: UserAssignedManagedIdentity
    userAssignedManagedIdentitySettings:
      clientId: <ID>
      tenantId: <ID>
      # Optional, defaults to 'https://eventgrid.azure.net/.default'
      # scope: https://<SCOPE_URL>
```

---

Here, the scope is optional and defaults to `https://eventgrid.azure.net/.default` which works for all Azure Event Grid namespaces. If you need to set a different scope, you can specify it in the settings via Bicep or Kubernetes.

### Kubernetes service account token (SAT)

To use Kubernetes service account token (SAT) for authentication, you don't need to create a secret. The SAT is used to authenticate with the MQTT broker by matching the audience.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Basic** tab then choose **Authentication method** > **Service account token**.

Enter the service audience.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  authentication: {
    method: 'ServiceAccountToken'
    serviceAccountTokenSettings: {
      audience: '<YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUDIENCE>'
    }
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: ServiceAccountToken
    serviceAccountTokenSettings:
      audience: <YOUR_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_AUDIENCE>
```

---

### Anonymous

To use anonymous authentication, set the authentication method to `Anonymous`.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

Not yet supported in the operations experience. See [known issues](../troubleshoot/known-issues.md).

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

Not yet supported with Bicep. See [known issues](../troubleshoot/known-issues.md).

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  authentication:
    method: Anonymous
    anonymousSettings:
      {}
```

---

## Advanced settings

You can set advanced settings for the MQTT broker dataflow endpoint such as TLS, trusted CA certificate, MQTT messaging settings, and CloudEvents. You can set these settings in the dataflow endpoint **Advanced** portal tab, within the dataflow endpoint custom resource.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience, select the **Advanced** tab for the dataflow endpoint.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
// See sections below for explanation of each setting
mqttSettings: {
  qos: 1
  retain: 'Keep'
  sessionExpirySeconds: 3600
  keepAliveSeconds: 60
  maxInflightMessages: 100
  protocol: WebSockets
  clientIdPrefix: 'dataflow'
  CloudEventAttributes: 'Propagate' // or 'CreateOrRemap'
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
# See sections below for explanation of each setting
mqttSettings:
  qos: 1
  retain: Keep
  sessionExpirySeconds: 3600
  keepAliveSeconds: 60
  maxInflightMessages: 100
  protocol: WebSockets
  clientIdPrefix: dataflow
  CloudEventAttributes: Propagate # or CreateOrRemap
```

---


### TLS settings

#### TLS mode

To enable or disable TLS for the Kafka endpoint, update the `mode` setting in the TLS settings.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the checkbox next to **TLS mode enabled**.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  tls: {
    mode: 'Enabled' // or 'Disabled'
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  tls:
    mode: Enabled # or Disabled
```

---

The TLS mode can be set to `Enabled` or `Disabled`. If the mode is set to `Enabled`, the dataflow uses a secure connection to the Kafka broker. If the mode is set to `Disabled`, the dataflow uses an insecure connection to the Kafka broker.

#### Trusted CA certificate

Configure the trusted CA certificate for the MQTT endpoint to establish a secure connection to the MQTT broker. This setting is important if the MQTT broker uses a self-signed certificate or a certificate signed by a custom CA that isn't trusted by default.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Trusted CA certificate config map** field to specify the ConfigMap containing the trusted CA certificate.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  tls: {
    trustedCaCertificateConfigMapRef: '<YOUR_CA_CERTIFICATE>'
  }
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  tls:
    trustedCaCertificateConfigMapRef: <YOUR_CA_CERTIFICATE>
```

---

This ConfigMap should contain the CA certificate in PEM format. The ConfigMap must be in the same namespace as the MQTT dataflow resource. For example:

```bash
kubectl create configmap client-ca-configmap --from-file root_ca.crt -n azure-iot-operations
```

---

> [!TIP]
> When connecting to Event Grid MQTT broker, the CA certificate isn't required because the Event Hubs service uses a certificate signed by a public CA that is trusted by default.

### Client ID prefix

You can set a client ID prefix for the MQTT client. The client ID is generated by appending the dataflow instance name to the prefix. 

> [!CAUTION]
> Most applications should not modify the client ID prefix. Don't modify this after an initial IoT Operations deployment. Changing the client ID prefix after deployment might result in data loss.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Client ID prefix** field to specify the prefix.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  clientIdPrefix: '<YOUR_PREFIX>'
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  clientIdPrefix: <YOUR_PREFIX>
```

---

### QoS

You can set the Quality of Service (QoS) level for the MQTT messages to either 1 or 0. The default is 1.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Quality of service (QoS)** field to specify the QoS level.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  qos: 1 // Or 0
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  qos: 1 # Or 0
```

---

### Retain

Use the `retain` setting to specify whether the dataflow should keep the retain flag on MQTT messages. The default is `Keep`.

Setting this field to `Keep` is useful to ensure that the remote broker has the same messages retained as the local broker, which can be important for Unified Namespace (UNS) scenarios.

If set to `Never`, the retain flag is removed from the MQTT messages. This can be useful when you don't want the remote broker to retain any messages or if the remote broker doesn't support retain.

To configure retain settings:

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Retain** field to specify the retain setting.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  retain: Keep // or Never
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  retain: Keep # or Never
```

---

The *retain* setting only takes effect if the dataflow uses MQTT endpoint as both source and destination. For example, in an [MQTT bridge](tutorial-mqtt-bridge.md) scenario.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Event Grid MQTT broker [currently doesn't support the retain flag](../../event-grid/mqtt-support.md#mqttv5-current-limitations). This means if you set the retain flag to `Keep` for an Event Grid MQTT broker endpoint and it's being used as a destination, the messages are rejected. To avoid this, set the retain flag to `Never` when using Event Grid MQTT broker as a destination.

### Session expiry

You can set the session expiry interval for the dataflow MQTT client. The session expiry interval is the maximum time that an MQTT session is maintained if the dataflow client disconnects. The default is 3600 seconds. To configure the session expiry interval:

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Session expiry** field to specify the session expiry interval.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  sessionExpirySeconds: 3600
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  sessionExpirySeconds: 3600
```

---

### MQTT or WebSockets protocol

By default, WebSockets isn't enabled. To use MQTT over WebSockets, set the `protocol` field to `WebSockets`.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Protocol** field to specify the protocol.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  protocol: 'WebSockets'
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  protocol: WebSockets
```

---

### Max inflight messages

You can set the maximum number of inflight messages that the dataflow MQTT client can have. The default is 100.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Maximum in-flight messages** field to specify the maximum number of inflight messages.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  maxInflightMessages: 100
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  maxInflightMessages: 100
```

---

For subscribe when the MQTT endpoint is used as a source, this is the receive maximum. For publish when the MQTT endpoint is used as a destination, this is the maximum number of messages to send before waiting for an acknowledgment.

### Keep alive

You can set the keep alive interval for the dataflow MQTT client. The keep alive interval is the maximum time that the dataflow client can be idle before sending a PINGREQ message to the broker. The default is 60 seconds.

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Keep alive** field to specify the keep alive interval.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  keepAliveSeconds: 60
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  keepAliveSeconds: 60
```

---

### CloudEvents

[CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/) are a way to describe event data in a common way. The CloudEvents settings are used to send or receive messages in the CloudEvents format. You can use CloudEvents for event-driven architectures where different services need to communicate with each other in the same or different cloud providers.

The `CloudEventAttributes` options are `Propagate` or`CreateOrRemap`. To configure CloudEvents settings:

# [Portal](#tab/portal)

In the operations experience dataflow endpoint settings page, select the **Advanced** tab then use the **Cloud event attributes** field to specify the CloudEvents setting.

# [Bicep](#tab/bicep)

```bicep
mqttSettings: {
  CloudEventAttributes: 'Propagate' // or 'CreateOrRemap'
}
```

# [Kubernetes](#tab/kubernetes)

```yaml
mqttSettings:
  CloudEventAttributes: Propagate # or CreateOrRemap
```

---

The following sections provide more information about the CloudEvents settings.

#### Propagate setting

CloudEvent properties are passed through for messages that contain the required properties. If the message doesn't contain the required properties, the message is passed through as is.

#### CreateOrRemap setting

CloudEvent properties are passed through for messages that contain the required properties. If the message doesn't contain the required properties, the properties are generated.

| Name              | Required | Generated value if missing                                                    |
