Currently, Microsoft validates Azure IoT Operations against the following fixed-set of infrastructures and environments:

| Environment | Version |
| ----------- | ------- |
| AKS-EE on Windows 11 IoT Enterprise <br> on a Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tiny machine (16 core, 32-GB RAM) with single-node cluster | AksEdge-K3s-1.29.6-1.8.202.0 |
| K3S on Ubuntu 24.04 <br> on a Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Tiny machine (16 core, 32-GB RAM) with a three-node cluster | K3s version 1.31.1 |

Azure IoT Operations doesn't support Arm64 architectures.
