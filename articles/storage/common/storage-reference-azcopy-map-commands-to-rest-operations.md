# Map of AzCopy v10 commands to Azure Blob Storage REST operations

When you run a command that operates on data in your storage account, AzCopy translates that command to a REST operation. This article maps AzCopy commands to Azure Blob Storage REST operations.  

## Command mapping

The following table shows the operations that are used by each AzCopy command. To determine the price of each operation, see [Map each REST operation to a price](../blobs/map-rest-apis-transaction-categories.md).
