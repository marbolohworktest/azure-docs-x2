# Develop Python applications that use Azure Files

[!INCLUDE [storage-selector-file-include](../../../includes/storage-selector-file-include.md)]

Learn the basics of using Python to develop apps or services that use Azure Files to store file data. Create a console app and learn how to perform basic actions with Python and Azure Files:

- Create Azure file shares
- Create directories
- Enumerate files and directories in an Azure file share
- Upload, download, and delete a file
- Create file share backups by using snapshots

> [!NOTE]
> Because Azure Files may be accessed over SMB, it's possible to write simple applications that access the Azure file share using the standard Python I/O classes and functions. This article describes how to write apps that use the Azure Storage SDK for Python, which uses the [Azure Files REST API](/rest/api/storageservices/file-service-rest-api) to talk to Azure Files.

## Applies to

| File share type | SMB | NFS |
|-|:-:|:-:|
| Standard file shares (GPv2), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Standard file shares (GPv2), GRS/GZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |
| Premium file shares (FileStorage), LRS/ZRS | ![Yes](../media/icons/yes-icon.png) | ![No](../media/icons/no-icon.png) |

## Download and Install Azure Storage SDK for Python

> [!NOTE]
> If you're upgrading from the Azure Storage SDK for Python version 0.36 or earlier, uninstall the older SDK using `pip uninstall azure-storage` before installing the latest package.

The [Azure Files client library for Python](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-python/tree/master/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share) requires Python 3.8+.

## Install via PyPI

To install via the Python Package Index (PyPI), type:

```console
pip install azure-storage-file-share
```

## Set up your application to use Azure Files

Add the following code near the top of a Python source file to use the code snippets in this article.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_Imports":::

## Set up a connection to Azure Files

[ShareServiceClient](/azure/developer/python/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.shareserviceclient) lets you work with shares, directories, and files. This code creates a `ShareServiceClient` object using the storage account connection string:

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_CreateShareServiceClient":::

## Create an Azure file share

The following code example uses a [ShareClient](/azure/developer/python/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.shareclient) object to create the share if it doesn't exist.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_CreateFileShare":::

## Create a directory

You can organize storage by putting files inside subdirectories instead of having all of them in the root directory.

The following method creates a directory in the root of the specified file share by using a [ShareDirectoryClient](/azure/developer/python/sdk/storage/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.sharedirectoryclient) object.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_CreateDirectory":::

## Upload a file

In this section, you learn how to upload a file from local storage into Azure Files.

The following method uploads the contents of the specified file into the specified directory in the specified Azure file share.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_UploadFile":::

## Enumerate files and directories in an Azure file share

To list the files and directories in a subdirectory, use the [list_directories_and_files](/python/api/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.ShareClient#azure-storage-fileshare-shareclient-list-directories-and-files) method. This method returns an auto-paging iterable. The following code outputs the **name** of each file and subdirectory in the specified directory to the console.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_ListFilesAndDirs":::

## Download a file

To download data from a file, use [download_file](/python/api/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.ShareFileClient#azure-storage-fileshare-sharefileclient-download-file).

The following example demonstrates using `download_file` to get the contents of the specified file and store it locally with **DOWNLOADED-** prepended to the filename.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_DownloadFile":::

## Create a share snapshot

You can create a point in time copy of your entire file share.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_CreateSnapshot":::

## List shares and snapshots

You can list all the snapshots for a particular share.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_ListSharesAndSnapshots":::

## Browse share snapshot

You can browse each share snapshot to retrieve files and directories from that point in time.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_BrowseSnapshotDir":::

## Get file from share snapshot

You can download a file from a share snapshot, which enables you to restore a previous version of a file.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_DownloadSnapshotFile":::

## Delete a single share snapshot

You can delete a single share snapshot.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_DeleteSnapshot":::

## Delete a file

To delete a file, call [delete_file](/python/api/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.ShareFileClient#azure-storage-fileshare-sharefileclient-delete-file).

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_DeleteFile":::

## Delete share when share snapshots exist

To delete a share that contains snapshots, call [delete_share](/python/api/azure-storage-file-share/azure.storage.fileshare.ShareClient#azure-storage-fileshare-shareclient-delete-share) with `delete_snapshots=True`.

:::code language="python" source="~/azure-storage-snippets/files/howto/python/python-v12/file_share_ops.py" id="Snippet_DeleteShare":::
