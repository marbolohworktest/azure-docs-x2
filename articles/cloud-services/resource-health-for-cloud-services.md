# Resource Health Check (RHC) Support for Azure Cloud Services (Classic)

[!INCLUDE [Cloud Services (classic) deprecation announcement](includes/deprecation-announcement.md)]

This article  talks about Resource Health Check (RHC) Support for [Microsoft Azure Cloud Services (Classic)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services)

[Azure Resource Health](/azure/service-health/resource-health-overview) for cloud services helps you diagnose and get support for service problems that affect your Cloud Service deployment, Roles & Role Instances. It reports on the current and past health of your cloud services at Deployment, Role & Role Instance level.

Azure status reports on problems that affect a broad set of Azure customers. Resource Health gives you a personalized dashboard of the health of your resources. Resource Health shows all the times that your resources were unavailable because of Azure service problems. This data makes it easy for you to see if a Service Level Agreement (SLA) was violated.

## How health is checked and reported?
Resource health is reported at a deployment or role level. The health check happens at role instance level. We aggregate the status and report it on Role level. For example, if all role instances are available, then the role status is available. Similarly, we aggregate the health status of all roles and report it on deployment level. For example, if all roles are available, then deployment status becomes available. 

## Why I can't see health status for my staging slot deployment?
Resource health checks only work for production slot deployment. Staging slot deployment isn't yet supported. 

## Does Resource Health Check also check the health of the application?
No, health check only happens for role instances and it doesn't monitor Application health. For example, even if one out of three role instances are unhealthy, the application can still be available. RHC doesn't use [load balancer probes](../load-balancer/load-balancer-custom-probe-overview.md) or Guest agent probe. Therefore,
Customers should continue to using load balancer probes to monitor the health of their application. 

## What are the annotations for Cloud Services?
Annotations are the health status of the deployment or roles. There are different annotations based on health status, reason for status change, etc. 

## What does it mean by Role Instance being "unavailable"?
Unavailable means the role instance isn't emitting a healthy signal to the platform. Check the role instance status for detailed explanation of why healthy signal isn't being emitted.

## What does it mean by deployment being "unknown"?
Unknown means the aggregated health of the Cloud Service deployment can't be determined. Usually, unknown indicates one of the following scenarios:
* There's no production deployment created for the Cloud Service
* The deployment was newly created (and that Azure is starting to collect health events)
* The platform is having issues collecting health events for this deployment.

## Why does Role Instance Annotations mention VMs instead of Role Instances?
Since Role Instances are, in essence, virtual machines (VMs), and the health check for VMs is reused for Role Instances, the VM term is used to represent Role Instances. 

## Cloud Services (Deployment Level) Annotations & their meanings
| Annotation | Description | 
| --- | --- | 
| Available| There aren't any known Azure platform problems affecting this Cloud Service deployment |
| Unknown | We're currently unable to determine the health of this Cloud Service deployment | 
| Setting up Resource Health | Setting up Resource health for this resource. Resource health watches your Azure resources to provide details about ongoing and past events that affected them|
| Degraded | Your Cloud Service deployment is degraded. We're working to automatically recover your Cloud Service deployment and to determine the source of the problem. No further action is required from you at this time |
| Unhealthy | Your Cloud Service deployment is unhealthy because {0} out of {1} role instances are unavailable |
| Degraded | Your Cloud Service deployment is degraded because {0} out of {1} role instances are unavailable | 
| Available and maybe impacted | Your Cloud Service deployment is running, however an ongoing Azure service outage may prevent you from connecting to it. Connectivity restores once the outage is resolved |
| Unavailable and maybe impacted | An Azure service outage possibly affected the health of this Cloud Service deployment. Your Cloud Service deployment recovers automatically when the outage is resolved |
| Unknown and maybe impacted | We're currently unable to determine the health of this Cloud Service deployment. This status could be a result of an ongoing Azure service outage that may be impacting this virtual machine, which recovers automatically when the outage is resolved |
