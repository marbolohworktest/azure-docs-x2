:::image type="content" source="media/whats-new-images/custom-background-video-calls.jpeg" alt-text="Screenshot that shows custom background for video calls." lightbox="media/whats-new-images/custom-background-video-calls.jpeg":::

For example, business owners can use the Calling SDK to show custom backgrounds in place of the actual background. You can, for example, upload an image of a modern and spacious office and set it as the background for video calls. Anyone who joins the call sees the customized background, which looks realistic and natural. You can also use custom branding images as a background to show fresh images to your customers.

For more information, see [Quickstart: Add video effects to your video calls](./quickstarts/voice-video-calling/get-started-video-effects.md).

#### Proxy configuration

Proxy configuration is now generally available. Some environments, such as industries that are highly regulated or that deal with confidential information, require proxies to help secure and control network traffic. You can use the Calling SDK to configure the HTTP and media proxies for your Azure Communication Services calls. This way, you can ensure that your communications are compliant with network policies and regulations. You can use the native SDK methods to set the proxy configuration for your app.

For more information, see [Proxy your calling traffic](./tutorials/proxy-calling-support-tutorial.md?pivots=platform-android).

#### Android TelecomManager integration

Android TelecomManager manages audio and video calls on Android devices. Use Android TelecomManager to provide a consistent user experience across various Android apps and devices, such as showing incoming and outgoing calls in the system UI, routing audio to devices, and handling call interruptions.

Now you can integrate your app with Android TelecomManager to take advantage of its features for your custom calling scenarios. For more information, see [Integrate with TelecomManager](./how-tos/calling-sdk/telecommanager-integration.md).

#### Unidirectional communication in Data Channel

The Data Channel API is generally available. Data Channel includes unidirectional communication, which enables real-time messaging during audio and video calls. By using this API, you can integrate data exchange functions into the applications to help provide a seamless communication experience for users.

The Data Channel API enables users to instantly send and receive messages during an ongoing audio or video call, promoting smooth and efficient communication. In a group call, a participant can send messages to a single participant, a specific set of participants, or all participants within the call. This flexibility enhances communication and collaboration among users during group interactions.

For more information, see [Data Channel](./concepts/voice-video-calling/data-channel.md).

#### Time-to-live lifespan for push notifications

The time to live (TTL) for push notifications is now generally available. TTL is the duration for which a push notification token is valid. Using a longer-duration TTL can help your app reduce the number of new token requests from your users and improve the experience.

For example, suppose you created an app that enables patients to book virtual medical appointments. The app uses push notifications to display an incoming call UI when the app isn't in the foreground. Previously, the app had to request a new push notification token from the user every 24 hours, which could be annoying and disruptive. With the extended TTL feature, you can now configure the push notification token to last for up to six months, depending on your business needs. This way, the app can avoid frequent token requests and provide a smoother calling experience for your customers.

For more information, see [Enable push notifications for calls](./how-tos/calling-sdk/push-notifications.md#ttl-token).

#### Troubleshooting on the native UI Library for Android and iOS

Now in general availability, you can encrypt logs when troubleshooting on the Calling SDK native UI Library for Android and iOS. You can easily generate encrypted logs to share with Azure support. Ideally, calls just work, or developers self-remediate issues. But customers always have Azure support as a last line of defense. And we strive to make those engagements as easy and fast as possible.

For more information, see [Troubleshoot the UI Library](./how-tos/ui-library-sdk/troubleshooting.md).

#### Audio-only mode in the UI Library

The audio-only mode in the Calling SDK UI Library is now generally available. It enables participants to join calls by using only their audio, without sharing or receiving video. Participants can use this feature to conserve bandwidth and maximize privacy.

When audio-only mode is activated, it automatically disables the video function for both sending and receiving streams. It adjusts the UI to reflect this change by removing video-related controls.

For more information, see [Enable audio-only mode in the UI Library](./how-tos/ui-library-sdk/audio-only-mode.md).

#### Opt-out management

Email opt-out management, now in preview, offers a centralized unsubscribe list and opt-out preferences saved to a data store. This feature helps developers meet guidelines of email providers who require one-click list-unsubscribe implementation in the emails sent from their platforms.

Opt-out management helps you identify and avoid delivery problems. You can maintain compliance by adding suppression list features to help improve reputation and enable customers to easily manage opt-outs.

### Limited-access user tokens

Limited-access user tokens are now in general availability. Limited-access user tokens enable customers to exercise finer control over user capabilities such as starting a new call/chat or participating in an ongoing call/chat.

When a customer creates an Azure Communication Services user identity, the user is granted the capability to participate in chats or calls through access tokens. For example, a user must have a chat token to participate in chat threads or a VoIP token to participate in VoIP calls. A user can have multiple tokens simultaneously.

With the limited-access tokens, Azure Communication Services supports controlling full access versus limited access within chats and calls. Customers can control users' ability to initiate a new call or chat, as opposed to participating in existing calls or chats.

These tokens solve the cold-call or cold-chat issue. For example, without limited-access tokens, a user who has a VoIP token can initiate calls and participate in calls. So theoretically, a defendant could call a judge directly or a patient could call a doctor directly. This situation is undesirable for most businesses. Developers can now give a limited-access token to a patient who then can join a call but can't initiate a direct call to anyone.

For more information, see [Identity model](./concepts/identity-model.md).

### Try Phone Calling

Try Phone Calling, now in preview, is a tool in the Azure portal that helps customers confirm the setup of a telephony connection by making a phone call. It applies to both voice calling (PSTN) and direct routing. Try Phone Calling enables developers to quickly test Azure Communication Services calling capabilities, without an existing app or code on their end.

:::image type="content" source="concepts/media/try-phone-calling.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Try Phone Calling tool in the Azure portal." lightbox="concepts/media/try-phone-calling.png":::

For more information, see [Try Phone Calling](./concepts/telephony/try-phone-calling.md).

### Native UI Library updates

Updates to the native UI Library including moving User Facing Diagnostics to general availability and releasing one-to-one calling and iOS CallKit integration.

#### User Facing Diagnostics

User Facing Diagnostics is now in general availability. This feature enhances the user experience by providing a set of events that can be triggered when some signal of the call is triggered. For example, an event can be triggered when a participant is talking but the microphone is muted, or if the device isn't connected to a network. You can subscribe to triggers such as weak network signals or muted microphones, so you're always aware of any factors that affect calls.

Bringing User Facing Diagnostics into the UI Library helps customers implement events for a more fluid experience. Customers can use User Facing Diagnostics to notify users in real time if they face connectivity and quality problems during the call, such as network problems. Users receive a pop-up notification about these problems during the call. This feature also sends telemetry to help you track any event and review the call status.

For more information, see [User Facing Diagnostics](./concepts/voice-video-calling/user-facing-diagnostics.md).

#### One-to-one calling

One-to-one calling for Android and iOS is now available in preview version 1.6.0. With this latest preview release, starting a call is as simple as a tap. Recipients are promptly alerted with a push notification to answer or decline the call.

If the iOS-native application requires direct calling between two entities, developers can use the one-to-one calling function to make it happen. An example scenario is a client who needs to call a financial advisor to make account changes.

For more information, see [Set up one-to-one calling and push notifications in the UI Library](./how-tos/ui-library-sdk/one-to-one-calling.md).

#### iOS CallKit integration

Azure Communication Services integrates CallKit, in preview, for a native iOS call experience. Now, calls made through the Native UI SDK have the same iOS calling features, such as notification, call history, and call on hold. These iOS features blend seamlessly with the existing native experience.

This update enables UI Library developers to avoid spending time on integration. CallKit provides an out-of-the-box experience, meaning that integrated apps use the same interfaces as regular cellular calls. For users, incoming VoIP calls display the familiar iOS call screen for a consistent and intuitive experience.

For more information, see [Integrate CallKit into the UI Library](./how-tos/ui-library-sdk/callkit.md).

### PSTN Direct Offers

Azure Communication Services continues to expand Direct Offers to new geographies. PSTN Direct Offers is in general availability for 42 countries:

> Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, UAE (United Arab Emirates), United Kingdom, United States

## January 2024

### Dial-out to a PSTN number

Virtual Rooms support VoIP audio and video calling. Now you can also dial out PSTN numbers and include the PSTN participants in an ongoing call.

Virtual Rooms empower developers to exercise control over PSTN dial-out capability in two ways. Developers can not only enable/disable PSTN dial-out capability for specific Virtual Rooms but also control which users in Virtual Rooms can initiate PSTN dial-out. Only users who have the Presenter role can initiate a PSTN dial-out, to help ensure secure and structured communication.

For more information, see [Quickstart: Create and manage a room resource](./quickstarts/rooms/get-started-rooms.md).

### Remote mute of call participants

Participants can now mute other participants in Virtual Rooms calls. Previously, participants in Virtual Rooms calls could only mute/unmute themselves. There are times when participants want to mute other people due to background noise or if someone's microphone is left unmuted.

Participants in the Presenter role can mute a participant, multiple participants, or all other participants. Users retain the ability to unmute themselves as needed. For privacy reasons, no one can unmute other participants.

For more information, see [Mute other participants](./how-tos/calling-sdk/manage-calls.md#mute-other-participants).

### Call recording in Virtual Rooms

Developers can now start, pause, and stop call recording in calls conducted in Virtual Rooms. Call recording is a service-side capability. Developers start, pause, and stop recording by using server-side API calls. This feature enables invited participants who might not make the original session to view the recording and stay up to date asynchronously.

For more information, see [Manage call recording on the client](./how-tos/calling-sdk/record-calls.md).

### Closed captions in Virtual Rooms

Closed captioning is the conversion of an audio track for a voice or video call into written words that appear in real time. Closed captions are a useful tool for participants who prefer to read the audio text in order to engage more actively in conversations and meetings. Closed captions also help in scenarios where participants might be in noisy environments or have audio equipment problems.

Closed captions are never saved and are visible only to the user who enabled them.
