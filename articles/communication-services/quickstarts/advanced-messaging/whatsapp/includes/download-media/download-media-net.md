### Set up the app framework

Open the *Program.cs* file in a text editor.   

Replace the contents of your *Program.cs* with the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Azure;
using Azure.Communication.Messages;

namespace AdvancedMessagingDownloadMediaQuickstart
{
    class Program
    {
        public static async Task Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Azure Communication Services - Download WhatsApp message media");

            // Quickstart code goes here
        }
    }
}
```

To use the Advanced Messaging features, we add a `using` directive to include the `Azure.Communication.Messages` namespace.

```csharp
using Azure.Communication.Messages;
```

## Object model
The following classes and interfaces handle some of the major features of the Azure Communication Services Advance Messaging SDK for .NET.

| Name                                                                                                             | Description                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [NotificationMessagesClient](/dotnet/api/azure.communication.messages.notificationmessagesclient)                | This class connects to your Azure Communication Services resource. It sends the messages.                   |
| [DownloadMediaAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.communication.messages.notificationmessagesclient.downloadmediaasync)     | Download the media payload from a User to Business message asynchronously, writing the content to a stream. |
| [DownloadMediaToAsync](/dotnet/api/azure.communication.messages.notificationmessagesclient.downloadmediatoasync) | Download the media payload from a User to Business message asynchronously, writing the content to a file.   |
| [Microsoft.Communication.AdvancedMessageReceived](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#microsoftcommunicationadvancedmessagereceived-event) | Event Grid event that is published when Advanced Messaging receives a message. |

## Code examples

Follow these steps to add the necessary code snippets to the Main function of your *Program.cs* file.

- [Authenticate the client](#authenticate-the-client)
- [Download the media payload to a stream](#download-the-media-payload-to-a-stream)
- [Download the media payload to a file](#download-the-media-payload-to-a-file)

### Authenticate the client   

The `NotificationMessagesClient` is used to connect to your Azure Communication Services resource.    

[!INCLUDE [Authenticate the NotificationMessagesClient](./../authenticate-notification-messages-client-net.md)]

### Download the media payload to a stream   

The Messages SDK allows Contoso to download the media in received WhatsApp media messages from WhatsApp users. To download the media payload to a stream, you need:
- [Authenticated NotificationMessagesClient](#authenticate-the-client)
- The media ID GUID of the media (Received from an incoming message in an [AdvancedMessageReceived event](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#microsoftcommunicationadvancedmessagereceived-event))


Define the media ID of the media you want to fetch.
```csharp
// MediaId GUID of the media received in an incoming message.
// Ex. "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
var mediaId = "<MediaId>";
```

Download the media to the destination stream:
```csharp
// Download media to stream
Response<Stream> fileResponse = await notificationMessagesClient.DownloadMediaAsync(mediaId);
```

The media payload is now available in the response stream.    
Continue on with this example to write the stream to a file.

The media ID and MIME type of the payload are available in the [media content](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#mediacontent) of the [AdvancedMessageReceived event](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#microsoftcommunicationadvancedmessagereceived-event). However, when downloading media to a stream, the MIME type is again available to you in the response headers in the `Response<Stream>`.
In either case, you need to convert the MIME type into a file type. Define this helper for the conversion.
```csharp
private static string GetFileExtension(string contentType)
{
    return MimeTypes.TryGetValue(contentType, out var extension) ? extension : string.Empty;
}

private static readonly Dictionary<string, string> MimeTypes = new Dictionary<string, string>
{
    { "application/pdf", ".pdf" },
    { "image/jpeg", ".jpg" },
    { "image/png", ".png" },
    { "video/mp4", ".mp4" },
    // Add more mappings as needed
};
```

Define the file location of where you want to write the media. This example uses the MIME type returned in the response headers from `DownloadMediaAsync`.
```csharp
// File extension derived from the MIME type in the response headers.
// Ex. A MIME type of "image/jpeg" would mean the fileExtension should be ".jpg"
var contentType = fileResponse.GetRawResponse().Headers.ContentType;
string fileExtension = GetFileExtension(contentType);

// File location to write the media. 
// Ex. @"c:\temp\media.jpg"
string filePath = @"<FilePath>" + "<FileName>" + fileExtension;
```

Write the stream to the file.
```csharp
 // Write the media stream to the file
using (Stream outStream = File.OpenWrite(filePath))
{
    fileResponse.Value.CopyTo(outStream);
}
```

### Download the media payload to a file   

The Messages SDK allows Contoso to download the media in WhatsApp media messages received from WhatsApp users. To download the media payload to a file, you need:
- [Authenticated NotificationMessagesClient](#authenticate-the-client)
- The media ID GUID of the media (Received from an incoming message in an [AdvancedMessageReceived event](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#microsoftcommunicationadvancedmessagereceived-event))
- The media file extension (Derived from the MIME type received in an incoming message with [media content](/azure/event-grid/communication-services-advanced-messaging-events#mediacontent))
- The destination file name (Generated name of your choosing)
- The destination file path (File path of your choosing)

Define the media ID of the media you want to fetch and the file location of where you want to write the media.
```csharp
// MediaId GUID of the media received in an incoming message.
// Ex. "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
var mediaId = "<MediaId>";

// File extension derived from the MIME type received in an incoming message
// Ex. A MIME type of "image/jpeg" would mean the fileExtension should be ".jpg"
string fileExtension = "<FileExtension>";
// File location to write the media. 
// Ex. @"c:\temp\media.jpg"
string filePath = @"<FilePath>" + "<FileName>" + fileExtension; 
```

Download the media to the destination path:
```csharp
// Download media to file
Response response = await notificationMessagesClient.DownloadMediaToAsync(mediaId, filePath);
```
