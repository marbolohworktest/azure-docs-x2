# Manage audio filters

Learn how to manage audio processing features with the Azure Communication Services SDKS. You learn how to apply different audio features before and during calls using audio filters. 

Currently, there are five different filters available to control.

## Analog Automatic gain control

Analog automatic gain control is a filter available before a call. By default, this filter is enabled.

## Digital Automatic gain control

Digital automatic gain control is a filter available before a call. By default, this filter is enabled.

## Music Mode

Music mode is a filter available before and during a call. Learn more about music mode [here](../../concepts/voice-video-calling/music-mode.md). Note that music mode only works in 1:1 calls on native platforms and group calls. Currently, music mode doesn't work in 1:1 calls between native and web. By default, music mode is disabled.

## Echo cancellation

Echo cancellation is a filter available before and during a call. You can only toggle echo cancellation only if music mode is enabled. By default, this filter is enabled.

## Noise suppression

Noise suppression is a filter available before and during a call. The currently available modes are `Off`, `Auto`, `Low`, and `High`. By default, this feature is set to `High` mode.
