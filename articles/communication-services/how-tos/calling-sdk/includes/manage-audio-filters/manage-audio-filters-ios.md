The audio filter feature enable you to apply different audio preprocessing to outgoing audio. There are two types of audio filters: `OutgoingAudioFilters` and `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters`. Use `OutgoingAudioFilters` to change settings before the call starts and `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters` to change settings while a call is in progress.

You first need to import the Calling SDK:

```swift
import AzureCommunicationCalling
```

## Before call starts

`OutgoingAudioFilters` can be applied when a call starts. 

Begin by creating a `OutgoingAudioFilters` and passing it into OutgoingAudioOptions as shown in the following code:

```swift
let outgoingAudioOptions = OutgoingAudioOptions()
let filters = OutgoingAudioFilters()
filters.NoiseSuppressionMode = NoiseSuppressionMode.high
filters.analogAutomaticGainControlEnabled = true
filters.digitalAutomaticGainControlEnabled = true
filters.musicModeEnabled = true
filters.acousticEchoCancellationEnabled = true
outgoingAudioOptions.audioFilters = filters
```

## During the call

You can apply `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters` after a call begins You can retrieve this object from the call object once the call begins. To change the setting in `LiveOutgoingAudioFilters`, set the members inside the class to a valid value and they're applied.

Only a subset of the filters available from `OutgoingAudioFilters` are available during an active call: music mode, echo cancellation, and noise suppression mode.

```swift
LiveOutgoingAudioFilters filters = call.liveOutgoingAudioFilters
filters.musicModeEnabled = true
filters.acousticEchoCancellationEnabled = true
filters.NoiseSuppressionMode = NoiseSuppressionMode.high
```
