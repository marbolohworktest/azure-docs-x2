# Configure a custom domain on Azure Front Door by using the Azure portal

When you use Azure Front Door for application delivery, a custom domain is necessary if you want your own domain name to be visible in your user requests. Having a visible domain name can be convenient for your customers and useful for branding purposes.

After you create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium profile and endpoint, the endpoint host is under a subdomain of `azurefd.net`. This subdomain gets included in the URL when Azure Front Door Standard/Premium delivers content from your back end by default. An example is `https://contoso-frontend-mdjf2jfgjf82mnzx.z01.azurefd.net/activeusers.htm`.

For your convenience, Azure Front Door provides the option of associating a custom domain. With this option, you deliver your content with a custom domain in your URL instead of a domain name that Azure Front Door owns. An example is `https://www.contoso.com/photo.png`.

## Prerequisites

* Before you can finish the steps in this tutorial, you must first create an Azure Front Door profile. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create an Azure Front Door Standard/Premium](create-front-door-portal.md).
* If you don't already have a custom domain, you must first purchase one with a domain provider. For example, see [Buy a custom domain name](../../app-service/manage-custom-dns-buy-domain.md).
* If you're using Azure to host your [DNS domains](../../dns/dns-overview.md), you must delegate the domain provider's domain name system (DNS) to Azure DNS. For more information, see [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](../../dns/dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md). Otherwise, if you're using a domain provider to handle your DNS domain, you must manually validate the domain by entering prompted DNS TXT records.

## Add a new custom domain

> [!NOTE]
> If a custom domain is validated in an Azure Front Door or a Microsoft CDN profile already, then it can't be added to another profile.

A custom domain is configured on the **Domains** pane of the Azure Front Door profile. A custom domain can be set up and validated before endpoint association. A custom domain and its subdomains can only be associated with a single endpoint at a time. However, you can use different subdomains from the same custom domain for different Azure Front Door profiles. You can also map custom domains with different subdomains to the same Azure Front Door endpoint.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Domains** for your Azure Front Door profile. Then select **+ Add**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-domain-button.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add a domain button on the domain landing pane.":::

1. On the **Add a domain** pane, select the domain type. You can choose **Non-Azure validated domain** or **Azure pre-validated domain**.

    * **Non-Azure validated domain** is a domain that requires ownership validation. When you select **Non-Azure validated domain**, we recommend that you use the Azure-managed DNS option. You might also use your own DNS provider. If you choose an Azure-managed DNS, select an existing DNS zone. Then select an existing custom subdomain or create a new one. If you're using another DNS provider, manually enter the custom domain name. Then select **Add** to add your custom domain.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-domain-page.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add a domain pane.":::

    * **Azure pre-validated domain** is a domain already validated by another Azure service. When you select this option, domain ownership validation isn't required from Azure Front Door. A dropdown list of validated domains by different Azure services appears.

        :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/pre-validated-custom-domain.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Pre-validated custom domains on the Add a domain pane.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > * Azure Front Door supports both Azure-managed certificates and Bring Your Own Certificates (BYOCs). For a non-Azure validated domain, the Azure-managed certificate is issued and managed by Azure Front Door. For an Azure prevalidated domain, the Azure-managed certificate gets issued and is managed by the Azure service that validates the domain. To use your own certificate, see [Configure HTTPS on a custom domain](how-to-configure-https-custom-domain.md).
    > * Azure Front Door supports Azure prevalidated domains and Azure DNS zones in different subscriptions.
    > * Currently, Azure prevalidated domains only support domains validated by Azure Static Web Apps.

    A new custom domain has a validation state of **Submitting**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validation-state-submitting.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the domain validation state as Submitting.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > * As of September 2023, Azure Front Door now supports BYOC-based domain ownership validation. Azure Front Door automatically approves the domain ownership if the Certificate Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) of the provided certificate matches the custom domain. When you select **Azure managed certificate**, the domain ownership continues to be validated via the DNS TXT record.
    > * For custom domains created before BYOC-based validation is supported and the domain validation status is anything but **Approved**, you need to trigger the auto-approval of the domain ownership validation by selecting **Validation State** > **Revalidate** in the portal. If you're using the command-line tool, you can trigger domain validation by sending an empty `PATCH` request to the domain API.
    > * An Azure prevalidated domain has a validation state of **Pending**. It automatically changes to **Approved** after a few minutes. After validation gets approved, skip to [Associate the custom domain to your Front Door endpoint](#associate-the-custom-domain-with-your-azure-front-door-endpoint) and finish the remaining steps.

    After a few minutes, the validation state changes to **Pending**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validation-state-pending.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the domain validation state as Pending.":::

1. Select the **Pending** validation state. A new pane appears with DNS TXT record information that's needed to validate the custom domain. The TXT record is in the form of `_dnsauth.<your_subdomain>`. If you're using an Azure DNS-based zone, select **Add**. A new TXT record with the record value that appears is created in the Azure DNS zone. If you're using another DNS provider, manually create a new TXT record named `_dnsauth.<your_subdomain>`, with the record value as shown on the pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/validate-custom-domain.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Validate the custom domain pane.":::

1. Close the pane to return to the custom domains list landing pane. The provisioning state of the custom domain should change to **Provisioned**. The validation state should change to **Approved**.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/provisioned-approved-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Provisioning state and the Approved status.":::

For more information about domain validation states, see [Domains in Azure Front Door](../domain.md#domain-validation).

## Associate the custom domain with your Azure Front Door endpoint

After you validate your custom domain, you can associate it with your Azure Front Door Standard/Premium endpoint.

1. Select the **Unassociated** link to open the **Associate endpoint and routes** pane. Select an endpoint and the routes with which you want to associate the domain. Then select **Associate** to update your configuration.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/associate-endpoint-routes.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Associate endpoint and routes pane.":::

    The **Endpoint association** status should change to reflect the endpoint to which the custom domain is currently associated.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/endpoint-association-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Endpoint association link.":::

1. Select the **DNS state** link.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/dns-state-link.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the DNS state link.":::

    > [!NOTE]
    > For an Azure prevalidated domain, go to the DNS hosting service and manually update the CNAME record for this domain from the other Azure service endpoint to Azure Front Door endpoint. This step is required, regardless of whether the domain is hosted with Azure DNS or with another DNS service. The link to update the CNAME from the **DNS state** column isn't available for this type of domain.

1. The **Add or update the CNAME record** pane appears with the CNAME record information that must be provided before traffic can start flowing. If you're using Azure DNS hosted zones, the CNAME records can be created by selecting **Add** on the pane. If you're using another DNS provider, you must manually enter the CNAME record name and value as shown on the pane.

    :::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/add-update-cname-record.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Add or update the CNAME record pane.":::

1. After the CNAME record is created and the custom domain is associated with the Azure Front Door endpoint, traffic starts flowing.

    > [!NOTE]
    > * If HTTPS is enabled, certificate provisioning and propagation might take a few minutes because propagation is being done to all edge locations.
    > * If your domain CNAME is indirectly pointed to an Azure Front Door endpoint, for example, by using Azure Traffic Manager for multi-CDN failover, the **DNS state** column shows as **CNAME/Alias record currently not detected**. Azure Front Door can't guarantee 100% detection of the CNAME record in this case. If you configured an Azure Front Door endpoint to Traffic Manager and still see this message, it doesn't mean that you didn't set up correctly. No further action is necessary from your side.

## Verify the custom domain

After you validate and associate the custom domain, verify that the custom domain is correctly referenced to your endpoint.

:::image type="content" source="../media/how-to-add-custom-domain/verify-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the validated and associated custom domain.":::

Lastly, validate that your application content is getting served by using a browser.
