> [!NOTE]
> Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription doesn't meet this requirement. To request an increase in your resource limit, see [Increase VM-family vCPU quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests). Note that the free trial subscription isn't eligible for a quota increase. Upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription before you request a quota increase. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure free account or Azure for Students Starter account](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md).
