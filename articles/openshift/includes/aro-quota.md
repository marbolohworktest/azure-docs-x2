> [!NOTE]
> Azure Red Hat OpenShift requires a minimum of 40 cores to create and run an OpenShift cluster. The default Azure resource quota for a new Azure subscription doesn't meet this requirement. To request an increase to your resource limit, see the section [Request an increase for non-adjustable quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests#request-an-increase-for-non-adjustable-quotas) in [Increase VM-family vCPU quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests). Because the kind of quota for which you need to request an increase is "non-adjustable", you must file a support ticket. The steps in [Request an increase for non-adjustable quotas](/azure/quotas/per-vm-quota-requests#request-an-increase-for-non-adjustable-quotas) show you exactly how to file the ticket with the correct content.
> 
> The free trial subscription isn't eligible for a quota increase. Upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription before you request a quota increase. For more information, see [Upgrade your Azure free account or Azure for Students Starter account](../../cost-management-billing/manage/upgrade-azure-subscription.md).
