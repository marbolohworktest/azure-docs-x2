# Generate and export certificates - Linux (strongSwan)

This article shows you how to create a self-signed root certificate and generate client certificates using strongSwan. The steps in this exercise help you create certificate **.pem** files. If you need *.pfx* and *.cer* files instead, see the [Windows- PowerShell](vpn-gateway-certificates-point-to-site.md) instructions.

For point-to-site connections, each VPN client must have a client certificate installed locally to connect. Additionally, the root certificate public key information must be uploaded to Azure. For more information, see [Point-to-site configuration - certificate authentication](point-to-site-certificate-gateway.md).
