# Install client certificates for P2S certificate authentication connections

When a P2S VPN gateway is configured to require certificate authentication, each client computer must have a client certificate installed locally. This article helps you install a client certificate locally on a client computer. You can also use [Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/vpn-settings-configure) to install certain VPN client profiles and certificates.

For information about generating certificates, see the [Generate certificates](point-to-site-certificate-gateway.md#generatecert) section of the Point-to-site configuration article.

The Linux client certificate is installed on the client as part of the client configuration. There are a few different methods to install certificates. You can use [strongSwan](point-to-site-vpn-client-certificate-ike-linux.md) steps, or [OpenVPN client](point-to-site-vpn-client-certificate-openvpn-linux.md).
