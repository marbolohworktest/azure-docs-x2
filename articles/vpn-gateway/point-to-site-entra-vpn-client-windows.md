# Configure Azure VPN Client – Microsoft Entra ID authentication – Windows

This article helps you configure the Azure VPN Client on a Windows computer to connect to a virtual network using a VPN Gateway point-to-site (P2S) VPN and Microsoft Entra ID authentication. For more information about point-to-site connections, see [About point-to-site connections](point-to-site-about.md). The Azure VPN Client is supported with Windows FIPS mode by using the [KB4577063](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4577063/windows-10-update-kb4577063) hotfix.

## Prerequisites

Configure your VPN gateway for point-to-site VPN connections that specify Microsoft Entra ID authentication. See [Configure a P2S VPN gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authentication](point-to-site-entra-gateway.md).

## Workflow

This article continues on from the [Configure a P2S VPN gateway for Microsoft Entra ID authentication](point-to-site-entra-gateway.md) steps. This article helps you:

1. Download and install the Azure VPN Client for Windows.
1. Extract the VPN client profile configuration files.
1. Update the profile configuration files with a custom audience value (if applicable).
1. Import the client profile settings to the VPN client.
1. Create a connection and connect to Azure.

## <a name="download"></a>Download the Azure VPN Client

[!INCLUDE [Download Azure VPN Client](../../includes/vpn-gateway-download-vpn-client.md)]

## <a name="generate"></a>Extract client profile configuration files

To configure your Azure VPN Client profile, you must first download the VPN client profile configuration package from the Azure P2S gateway. This package is specific to the configured VPN gateway and contains the necessary settings to configure the VPN client. If you used the P2S server configuration steps as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites) section, you've already generated and downloaded the VPN client profile configuration package that contains the VPN profile configuration files. If you need to generate configuration files, see [Download the VPN client profile configuration package](point-to-site-entra-gateway.md#download).

After you obtain the VPN client profile configuration package, extract the zip file. The zip file contains the **AzureVPN** folder. The **AzureVPN** folder contains the **azurevpnconfig_aad.xml** file or the **azurevpnconfig.xml** file, depending on whether your P2S configuration includes multiple authentication types. If you don't see **azurevpnconfig_aad.xml** or **azurevpnconfig.xml**, or you don't have an **AzureVPN** folder, verify that your VPN gateway is configured to use the OpenVPN tunnel type and that Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) authentication is selected.

## <a name="modify"></a>Modify profile configuration files

If your P2S configuration uses a custom audience and your registered app is associated with Microsoft-registered App ID, you might receive the error message **AADSTS650057** when you try to connect. Entering your Entra ID credential in pop-up for the second time will resolve the issue. This happens because the VPN client profile needs both the custom audience ID and the Microsoft application ID. To prevent this, modify your profile configuration .xml file to include both the custom application ID and the Microsoft application ID.

## <a name="import"></a>Import client profile configuration settings

1. On the page, select **Import**.

1. Browse to the Azure VPN Client profile configuration folder that you extracted. Open the **AzureVPN** folder and select the client profile configuration file (azurevpnconfig_aad.xml or azurevpnconfig.xml). Select **Open** to import the file.

1. Change the name of the Connection name (optional). In this example, notice that the Audience value shown is the new Azure Public value associated to the Microsoft-registered Azure VPN Client App ID. The value in this field must match the value that your P2S VPN gateway is configured to use.
