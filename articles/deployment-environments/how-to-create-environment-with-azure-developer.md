# Create an environment by using the Azure Developer CLI

In this article, you install the Azure Developer CLI (AZD), create a new deployment environment by provisioning your app infrastructure to Azure Deployment Environments, and deploy your app code onto the provisioned deployment environment.

Azure Developer CLI (AZD) is an open-source tool that accelerates the time it takes for you to get your application from local development environment to Azure. AZD provides best practice, developer-friendly commands that map to key stages in your workflow, whether you're working in the terminal, your editor or integrated development environment (IDE), or CI/CD (continuous integration/continuous deployment).

To learn how to set up AZD to work with Azure Deployment Environments, see [Use Azure Developer CLI with Azure Deployment Environments](/azure/deployment-environments/concept-azure-developer-cli-with-deployment-environments).

## Prerequisites

You should:
- Be familiar with Azure Deployment Environments. Review [What is Azure Deployment Environments?](overview-what-is-azure-deployment-environments.md) and [Key concepts for Azure Deployment Environments](concept-environments-key-concepts.md).
- Create and configure a dev center with a project, environment types, and a catalog. Use the following article as guidance:
   - [Quickstart: Configure Azure Deployment Environments](/azure/deployment-environments/quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter).
- A catalog attached to your dev center.

## Prepare to work with AZD 

When you work with AZD for the first time, there are some one-time setup tasks you need to complete. These tasks include installing the Azure Developer CLI, signing in to your Azure account, and enabling AZD support for Azure Deployment Environments.

### Install the Azure Developer CLI

When you install azd, the azd tools are installed within azd scope rather than globally, and are removed if azd is uninstalled. To use azd tools in Visual Studio Code, install the extension.

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

To enable Azure Developer CLI features in Visual Studio Code, install the Azure Developer CLI extension, version v0.8.3. Select the **Extensions** icon in the Activity bar, search for **Azure Developer CLI**, and then select **Install**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/install-azure-developer-cli-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code, showing the Sign in command in the command palette." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/install-azure-developer-cli-large.png":::

# [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-developer-cli)


```bash
powershell -ex AllSigned -c "Invoke-RestMethod 'https://aka.ms/install-azd.ps1' | Invoke-Expression"
```

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

In Visual Studio 2022 17.3 Preview 2 or later, you can enable integration with azd as a preview feature. 

To enable the azd feature, go to **Tools** > **Options** > **Environment** > **Preview Features** and select **Integration with azd, the Azure Developer CLI**.

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-visual-studio.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Visual Studio Preview features dialog, with Integration with azd, the Azure Developer CLI selected." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-visual-studio.png":::

When the feature is enabled, you can use the Azure Developer CLI from your terminal of choice on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

---

### Sign in with Azure Developer CLI

Access your Azure resources by logging in. When you initiate a log in, a browser window opens and prompts you to log in to Azure. After you sign in, the terminal displays a message that you're signed in to Azure.

Sign in to AZD using the command palette:

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code, showing the Extensions pane with the Azure Developer CLI and Install highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-sign-in.png":::

The output of commands issued from the command palette is displayed in an **azd dev** terminal like the following example:

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/press-any-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the azd dev terminal, showing the press any key to close message." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/press-any-key.png":::

# [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-developer-cli)

Sign in to Azure at the CLI using the following command: 

```bash
 azd auth login
```

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/login.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the azd auth login command and its result in the terminal." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/login.png":::

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

Access your Azure resources by logging in. When you initiate a log in, a browser window opens and prompts you to log in to Azure. After you sign in, the terminal displays a message that you're signed in to Azure.

To open the Developer Command prompt:

1. From the Tools menu, select **Terminal**.
1. In the **Terminal** window, select **Developer Command Prompt**.

Sign in to AZD using the Developer Command Terminal:

```bash
 azd auth login
```

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/visual-studio-azure-developer-login.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the azd auth login command and its result in the Developer Command Prompt." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/visual-studio-azure-developer-login.png":::

---

### Enable AZD support for ADE

You can configure AZD to provision and deploy resources to your deployment environments using standard commands such as `azd up` or `azd provision`. When `platform.type` is set to `devcenter`, all AZD remote environment state and provisioning uses dev center components. AZD uses one of the infrastructure templates defined in your dev center catalog for resource provisioning. In this configuration, the *infra* folder in your local templates isn't used. 

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

:::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-enable-support.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Visual Studio Code, showing the Enable support command in the command palette." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/azure-developer-enable-support.png":::


# [Azure Developer CLI](#tab/azure-developer-cli)

```bash
 azd config set platform.type devcenter
```

# [Visual Studio](#tab/visual-studio)

```bash
 azd config set platform.type devcenter
```
---

## Create an environment from existing code

Now you're ready to create an environment to work in. You can begin with code in a local folder, or you can clone an existing repository. In this example, you create an environment by using code in a local folder. 

### Initialize a new application

Initializing a new application creates the files and folders that are required for AZD to work with your application.

AZD uses an *azure.yaml* file to define the environment. The azure.yaml file defines and describes the apps and types of Azure resources that the application uses. To learn more about azure.yaml, see [Azure Developer CLI's azure.yaml schema](/azure/developer/azure-developer-cli/azd-schema).

# [Visual Studio Code](#tab/visual-studio-code)

1. In Visual Studio Code, open the folder that contains your application code.

1. Open the command palette, and enter *Azure Developer CLI init*, then from the list, select **Azure Developer CLI (azd): init**.
 
    :::image type="content" source="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/command-palette-azure-developer-initialize.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Visual Studio Code command palette with Azure Developer CLI (azd): init highlighted." lightbox="media/how-to-create-environment-with-azure-developer/command-palette-azure-developer-initialize.png":::
