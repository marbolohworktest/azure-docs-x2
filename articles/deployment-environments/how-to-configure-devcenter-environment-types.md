# Configure environment types for a dev center

In Azure Deployment Environments, you use [environment types](./concept-environments-key-concepts.md#dev-center-environment-types) to define the environments that development teams can deploy. You have the flexibility to name the environment types according to the nomenclature that your enterprise uses: for example, *sandbox*, *dev*, *test*, or *production*. You can specify deployment settings and the permissions that are available to developers per environment type and per project. 

In this article, you'll learn how to:

* Add a new environment type to a dev center.
* Delete an environment type from a dev center.

## Add a new dev center environment type

To add a new environment type to the dev center:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to Azure Deployment Environments.
1. Select your dev center from the list.
1. Select **Environment types** from the left pane.
1. Select **+ Create**.
1. On the **Create environment type** page, add the following details:
   1. For **Name**, add a name for the environment type.
   1. For **Tags**, add tags by adding **Name** and **Value** information (optional).
1. Select **Add**.

>[!NOTE]
> A dev center environment type is available to a specific project only after you add an associated [project environment type](how-to-configure-project-environment-types.md).

## Delete a dev center environment type

> [!NOTE]
> You can't delete a dev center environment type if any existing project environment types or deployed environments reference it. Delete all the associated project environment types and deployed environments before you try to delete a dev center environment type.
 
When you delete an environment type, it's no longer available when you deploy environments or configure new project environment types.

To delete an environment type from a dev center:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and go to Azure Deployment Environments.
1. Select your dev center from the list.
1. Select **Environment types** from the left pane.
1. Select the environment types that you want to delete.
1. Select **Delete** and then confirm.
