# Create and configure a project by using the Azure CLI

This quickstart guide shows you how to create a project in Azure Deployment Environments. Then, you associate the project with the dev center you created in [Create and configure a dev center by using the Azure CLI](how-to-create-configure-dev-center.md).

A platform engineering team typically creates projects and provides project access to development teams. Development teams then create [environments](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environments) by using [environment definitions](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#environment-definitions), connect to individual resources, and deploy applications.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- Azure role-based access control role with permissions to create and manage resources in the subscription, such as [Contributor](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#contributor) or [Owner](../role-based-access-control/built-in-roles.md#owner).

## Create a project

To create a project in your dev center:

1. Sign in to the Azure CLI:

    ```azurecli
    az login
    ```

1. Install the Azure CLI *devcenter* extension.

   ```azurecli
   az extension add --name devcenter --upgrade
   ```

1. Configure the default subscription as the subscription where your dev center resides:

   ```azurecli
   az account set --subscription <subscriptionName>
   ```

1. Configure the default resource group as the resource group where your dev center resides:

   ```azurecli
   az configure --defaults group=<resourceGroupName>
   ```

1. Configure the default location as the location where your dev center resides. Location of project must match the location of dev center:

   ```azurecli
   az configure --defaults location=eastus
   ```

1. Retrieve dev center resource ID:

    ```azurecli
    DEVCID=$(az devcenter admin devcenter show -n <devcenterName> --query id -o tsv)
    echo $DEVCID
    ```

1. Create project in dev center:

    ```azurecli
    az devcenter admin project create -n <projectName> \
    --description "My first project." \
    --dev-center-id $DEVCID
    ```

1. Confirm that the project was successfully created:

    ```azurecli
    az devcenter admin project show -n <projectName>
    ```

### Assign the Owner role to a managed identity

Before you can create environment types, you must give the managed identity that represents your dev center access to the subscriptions where you configure the [project environment types](concept-environments-key-concepts.md#project-environment-types). 

In this quickstart, you assign the Owner role to the system-assigned managed identity that you configured previously: [Attach a system-assigned managed identity](quickstart-create-and-configure-devcenter.md#attach-a-system-assigned-managed-identity).

1. Retrieve Subscription ID:

    ```azurecli
    SUBID=$(az account show --name <subscriptionName> --query id -o tsv)
    echo $SUBID
    ```

1. Retrieve the Object ID of the dev center's identity using the name of the dev center resource:

    ```azurecli
    OID=$(az ad sp list --display-name <devcenterName> --query [].id -o tsv)
    echo $OID
    ```

1. Assign the role of Owner to the dev center on the subscription:

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create --assignee $OID \
    --role "Owner" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBID"
    ```

## Configure a project

To configure a project, add a [project environment type](how-to-configure-project-environment-types.md):

1. Retrieve the Role ID for the Owner of the subscription:

    ```azurecli
    # Remove group default scope for next command. Leave blank for group.
    az configure --defaults group=

    ROID=$(az role definition list -n "Owner" --scope /subscriptions/$SUBID --query [].name -o tsv)
    echo $ROID

    # Set default resource group again
    az configure --defaults group=<resourceGroupName>
    ```

1. Show allowed environment type for the project:

    ```azurecli
    az devcenter admin project-allowed-environment-type list --project <projectName> --query [].name
    ```

1. Choose an environment type and create it for the project:

    ```azurecli
    az devcenter admin project-environment-type create -n <availableEnvironmentType> \
    --project <projectName> \
    --identity-type "SystemAssigned" \
    --roles "{\"${ROID}\":{}}" \
    --deployment-target-id "/subscriptions/${SUBID}" \
    --status Enabled
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> At least one identity (system-assigned or user-assigned) must be enabled for deployment identity. The identity is used to perform the environment deployment on behalf of the developer. Additionally, the identity attached to the dev center should be [assigned the Owner role](how-to-configure-managed-identity.md) for access to the deployment subscription for each environment type.

## Assign environment access

In this quickstart, you give access to your own ID. Optionally, you can replace the value of `--assignee` for the following commands with another member's object ID.

1. Retrieve your own Object ID:

    ```azurecli
    MYOID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --query id -o tsv)
    echo $MYOID
    ```

1. Assign admin access:

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create --assignee $MYOID \
    --role "DevCenter Project Admin" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBID"
    ```

1. Optionally, you can assign the Dev Environment User role:

    ```azurecli
    az role assignment create --assignee $MYOID \
    --role "Deployment Environments User" \
    --scope "/subscriptions/$SUBID"
    ```

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you created a project and granted project access to your development team. To learn how your development team members can create environments, advance to the next quickstart.
