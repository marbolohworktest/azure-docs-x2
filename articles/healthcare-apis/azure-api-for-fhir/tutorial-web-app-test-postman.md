# Testing the FHIR API on Azure API for FHIR

[!INCLUDE[retirement banner](../includes/healthcare-apis-azure-api-fhir-retirement.md)]

In the previous tutorial, you deployed the Azure API for FHIR&reg; and registered your client application. You're now ready to test your Azure API for FHIR.

## Retrieve the capability statement

First we get the capability statement for your Azure API for FHIR.
1. Open Postman.
1. Retrieve the capability statement by using `GET https://\<FHIR-SERVER-NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com/metadata`. In the image below the FHIR server name is **fhirserver**.

![Capability Statement](media/tutorial-web-app/postman-capability-statement.png)

Next we attempt to retrieve a patient. To retrieve a patient, use `GET https://\<FHIR-SERVER-NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com/Patient`. You receive a `401 Unauthorized` error because you haven't proven you should have access to patient data.

## Get patient from FHIR server

In order to gain access, you need an access token.

1. Select **Authorization** and set the Type to **OAuth2.0** in Postman.
1. Select **Get New Access Token**.
1. Fill in the fields and select **Request Token**. Below you can see the values for each field for this tutorial.

|Field                |Value                                                               |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Token Name           |A name for your token                                               |
|Grant Type           |Authorization Code                                                  |
|Callback URL         |https://www.getpostman.com/oauth2/callback                          |
|Auth URL             |https://login.microsoftonline.com/\<AZURE-AD-TENANT-ID>/oauth2/?resource=https://\<FHIR-SERVER-NAME>.azurehealthcareapis.com|
|Access Token URL     |https://login.microsoftonline.com/\<AZURE-AD-TENANT-ID>/oauth2/token|
|Client ID            |The client ID that you copied during the previous steps             |
|Client Secret        |\<BLANK>                                                            |
|Scope                |\<BLANK>                                                            |
|State                |1234                                                                |
|Client Authentication|Send client credentials in body                                     |

4. Sign in with your credentials and select **Accept**
1. Scroll down on the result and select **Use Token**
1. Select **Send** again at the top and this time you should get a result:

## Post patient into FHIR server

Now that you have access, you can create a new patient. Here's a sample of a simple patient you can add into your FHIR server. Enter this `json` into the **Body** section of Postman.

``` json
    {
        "resourceType": "Patient",
        "active": true,
        "name": [
            {
                "use": "official",
                "family": "Kirk",
                "given": [
                    "James",
                    "Tiberious"
                ]
            },
            {
                "use": "usual",
                "given": [
                    "Jim"
                ]
            }
        ],
        "gender": "male",
        "birthDate": "1960-12-25"
    }
```
This POST creates a new patient in your FHIR server with the name James Tiberious Kirk.

If you use the GET command to retrieve a patient again, you'll see James Tiberious Kirk listed in the output.

> [!NOTE]
> When sending requests to the Azure API for FHIR, you need to ensure that you've set the content-type header to `application/json`

## Troubleshooting access issues

If you ran into issues during any of these steps, review the documents we have put together on Microsoft Entra ID and the Azure API for FHIR.

* [Microsoft Entra ID and Azure API for FHIR](azure-active-directory-identity-configuration.md) - This document outlines some of the basic principles of Microsoft Entra ID and how it interacts with the Azure API for FHIR.
* [Access token validation](azure-api-fhir-access-token-validation.md) - This how-to guide gives more specific details on access token validation and steps to take to resolve access issues.

## Next Steps

Now that you can successfully connect to your client application, youâ€™re ready to write your web application.
