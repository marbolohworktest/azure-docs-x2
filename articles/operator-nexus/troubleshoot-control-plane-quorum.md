# Troubleshoot control plane quorum loss

Follow this troubleshooting guide when multiple control plane nodes are offline or unavailable:

## Prerequisites

- Install the latest version of the
  [appropriate Azure CLI extensions](./howto-install-cli-extensions.md).
- Gather the following information:
  - Subscription ID
  - Cluster name and resource group
  - Bare metal machine name
- Ensure you're logged using `az login`


## Symptoms

- Kubernetes API isn't available
- Multiple control plane nodes are offline or unavailable

## Procedure

1. Identify the Nexus Management Node
- To identify the management nodes, run `az networkcloud baremetalmachine list -g <ResourceGroup_Name>`
- Log in to the identified server
- Ensure the ironic-conductor service is present on this node using `crictl ps -a |grep -i ironic-conductor`
  Example output:

~~~
testuser@<servername> [ ~ ]$ sudo crictl ps -a |grep -i ironic-conductor
<id>       <id>       6 hours ago       Running       ironic-conductor       0       <id>
~~~

2. Determine the iDRAC IP of the server
- Run the command `az networkcloud cluster list -g <RG_Name>`
- The output of the command is a JSON with the iDRAC IP

    ~~~
    {
            "bmcConnectionString": "redfish+https://xx.xx.xx.xx/redfish/v1/Systems/System.Embedded.1",
            "bmcCredentials": {
              "username": "<username>"
            },
            "bmcMacAddress": "<bmcMacAddress>",
            "bootMacAddress": "<bootMacAddress",
            "machineDetails": "extraDetails",
            "machineName": "<machineName>",
            "rackSlot": <rackSlot>,
            "serialNumber": "<serialNumber>"
    },
    ~~~

3. Access the iDRAC GUI using the IP in your browser to shut down impacted management servers

4. When all impacted management servers are down, turn on the servers using the iDRAC GUI

5. The servers should now be restored.
