# Tutorial: Downlink data from public satellites

You can communicate with satellites directly from Azure by using the Azure Orbital Ground Station service. After you downlink data, you can process and analyze it in Azure. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create a spacecraft for select public satellites.
> * Prepare a virtual machine (VM) to receive downlinked data.
> * Configure a contact profile for a downlink mission.
> * Schedule a contact with a supported public satellite using Azure Orbital Ground Station and save the downlinked data.

Azure Orbital Ground Station supports several public satellites including [Aqua](https://aqua.nasa.gov/content/about-aqua), [Suomi NPP](https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/suomi-national-polar-orbiting-partnership), [JPSS-1/NOAA-20](https://eospso.nasa.gov/missions/joint-polar-satellite-system-1), and [Terra](https://terra.nasa.gov/about).

## Prerequisites

4. Search for your desired public satellite in [CelesTrak](https://celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/gp.php?GROUP=active&FORMAT=tle) and identify its current Two-Line Element (TLE).
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > Be sure to update this TLE to the most current value before you schedule a contact. A TLE that's more than two weeks old might result in an unsuccessful downlink.
   >
   > [Read more about TLE values](spacecraft-object.md#ephemeris).

5. In **Create spacecraft resource**, on the **Basics** tab, enter or select the following information:

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Subscription** | Select your subscription. |
   | **Resource Group** | Select your resource group. |
   | **Name** | Enter the **name** of the public spacecraft. |
   | **Region** | Select **West US 2**. |
   | **NORAD ID** | Enter the **NORAD ID** from the table above. |
   | **TLE title line** | Enter **AQUA**, **SUOMI NPP**, **NOAA 20**, or **TERRA**. |

8. Click **Review + create**. After the validation is complete, click **Create**.

If your spacecraft resource exactly matches the information in Step 3, your spacecraft is automatically authorized at Microsoft ground stations.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can confirm that your spacecraft resource is authorized by checking that the **Authorization status** shows **Allowed** on the spacecraft's overview page.

## Prepare your virtual machine and network to receive public satellite data

1. [Create a virtual network](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md) to host your data endpoint virtual machine (VM) using the same subscription and resource group where your spacecraft resource is located.

2. [Create a virtual machine](../virtual-network/quick-create-portal.md#create-virtual-machines) within the virtual network that you created using the same subscription and resource group where your spacecraft resource is located. Ensure that this VM has the following specifications:
   - Under the Basics tab:
      - **Image**: the operating system is Linux (**Ubuntu 20.04** or later).
      - **Size** the VM has at least **32 GiB** of RAM.
   - Under the Networking tab:
      - **Public IP**: the VM has internet access for downloading tools by having one standard public IP address.

   > [!TIP]
   > The public IP address here is only for internet connectivity, not contact data. For more information, see [Default outbound access in Azure](../virtual-network/ip-services/default-outbound-access.md).

3. Navigate to the newly created VM. Follow the instructions linked in Step 2 to connect to the VM. At the bash prompt for your VM, enter the following commands to create a temporary file system (*tmpfs*) on the VM. This VM is where the data will be written to avoid slow writes to disk.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This command references Aqua. Edit the command to reflect the public spacecraft you're using.

   ```console
   sudo mkdir /media/aqua
   sudo mount -t tmpfs -o size=28G tmpfs /media/aqua
   ```
4. Enter the following command in your VM to ensure that the Socat tool is installed on the machine:

   ```console
   sudo apt install socat
   ```
5. Follow instructions to [delegate a subnet](prepare-network.md#create-and-prepare-subnet-for-vnet-injection) to Azure Orbital Ground Station.
   
6. Follow instructions to [prepare your VM endpoint](prepare-network.md#prepare-endpoints). Enter the following command in your VM to set the MTU level to 3650:

   ```console
   sudo ifconfig eth0 3650
   ```

## Configure Event Hubs for antenna telemetry

To receive antenna telemetry during contacts with your selected public satellite, follow instructions to [create and configure an Azure event hub](receive-real-time-telemetry.md#configure-event-hubs) in your subscription.

## Configure a contact profile to downlink from a public satellite

1. In the Azure portal's search box, enter **Contact Profiles**. Select **Contact Profiles** in the search results. 
2. On the **Contact Profiles** page, click **Create**.
3. In **Create Contact Profile resource**, on the **Basics** tab, enter or select the following information:

   | **Field** | **Value** |

## Schedule a contact with Aqua and save the downlinked data

   > [!NOTE]
   > Check [public satellite schedules](https://directreadout.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/?id=dspContent&cid=14) to understand if there may be public broadcast outages. Azure Orbital Ground Station does not control the public satellites and cannot guarantee availability of data during the pass.

1. In the Azure portal's search box, enter **Spacecraft**. Select **Spacecraft** in the search results.
2. On the **Spacecraft** page, select your public spacecraft resource.
3. Click **Schedule contact** on the top bar of the spacecraft's overview.
4. On the **Schedule contact** page, specify the following information:

   | **Field** | **Value** |
   | --- | --- |
   | **Contact profile** | Select the **contact profile** you previously created. |
   | **Ground station** | Select **Microsoft_Quincy**. |
   | **Start time** | Identify a start time for the contact availability window. |
   | **End time** | Identify an end time for the contact availability window. |

5. Click **Search** to view available contact times.
6. Select one or more contact windows, and then click **Schedule**.
7. View the scheduled contact by selecting the spacecraft resource, navigating to Configurations on the left panel, and clicking **Contacts**.
8. Shortly before you start running the contact, start listening on port 56001 and output the data received in the file: 

   > [!NOTE]
   > This command references Aqua. Edit the command to reflect the public spacecraft you're using. In addition, you may need to add sudo.

   ```console
   socat -u tcp-listen:56001,fork create:/media/aqua/out.bin
   ```
9. After you run your contact, copy the output file from *tmpfs* into your home directory, to avoid overwriting the file when you run another contact:

   > [!NOTE]
   > This command references Aqua. Edit the command to reflect the public spacecraft you're using.

   ```console
   mkdir ~/aquadata
   cp /media/aqua/out.bin ~/aquadata/raw-$(date +"%FT%H%M%z").bin
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> For a 10-minute contact with Aqua while it's transmitting with 15 MHz of bandwidth, you should expect to receive around 450 MB of data.
