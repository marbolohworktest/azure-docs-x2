# Schedule a contact

Schedule a contact with your satellite for data retrieval and delivery on Azure Orbital Ground Station. At the scheduled time, the selected ground station will contact the spacecraft and start data retrieval/delivery using the designated contact profile. Learn more about [contact resources](concepts-contact.md).

Contacts are created on a per-pass and per-site basis. If you already know the pass timings for your spacecraft and desired ground station, you can directly proceed to schedule the pass with these times. The service will succeed in creating the contact resource if the window is available and fail if the window is unavailable.

If you don't know your spacecraft's pass timings or which ground station sites are available, you can use the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/orbital/portal) or [Azure Orbital Ground Station API](/rest/api/orbital/) to query for available contact opportunities and use the results to schedule your passes accordingly.

| Method | List available contacts | Schedule contacts | Notes |
|-|-|-|-|
|Portal| Yes | Yes | Custom pass timings aren't supported. You must use the results from the query. |
|API | Yes | Yes | Custom pass timings are supported. |

> [!NOTE]
> The new contact resource includes two properties: Provisioning State and Contact Status.
>
> [Provisioning state](/rest/api/orbital/azureorbitalgroundstation/contacts/create#provisioningstate) is the current state of the resource's creation, deletion, or modification in Azure.
>
> [Contact Status](/rest/api/orbital/azureorbitalgroundstation/contacts/create#contactsstatus) is the execution status of the contact resource. Values include scheduled, cancelled, providerCancelled, succeeded, and failed.
>
> The value of these properties can be found under the **Essentials** section of the contact overview page.

## API method

Use the Contacts REST Operation Group to [create a contact](/rest/api/orbital/azureorbitalgroundstation/contacts/create/) with the Azure Orbital Ground Station API.
