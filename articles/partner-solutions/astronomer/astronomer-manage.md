# Manage your Astro  integration through the portal

## Single sign-on

Single sign-on (SSO) is already enabled when you created your Astro  resource. To access Astro through SSO, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the Overview for your instance of the Astro resource. Select on the SSO Url.

1. The first time you access this Url, depending on your Azure tenant settings, you might see a request to grant permissions and User consent. This step is only needed the first time you access the SSO Url.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you are also seeing Admin consent screen then please check your [tenant consent settings](/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/configure-user-consent).
   >

1. Choose a Microsoft Entra account for the Single Sign-on. Once consent is provided, you're redirected to the Astro portal.

## Delete an Astro deployment

Once the Astro resource is deleted, all billing stops for that resource through Azure Marketplace. If you're done using your resource and would like to delete the same, follow these steps:

1. From the Resource menu, select the Astro deployment you would like to delete.

1. On the working pane of the **Overview**, select **Delete**.
