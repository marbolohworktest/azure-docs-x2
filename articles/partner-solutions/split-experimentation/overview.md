# What is Split Experimentation Workspace (preview)?

Split Experimentation for Azure App Configuration (preview) allows developers to test different variants of a feature and monitor the impact at the feature-level. Once configured, users will be able to analyze each individual feature, compare different variants, and promptly assess relevant metrics for new product changes. This capability empowers development teams with measurable insights, facilitating quicker and safer product deployments.  

This functionality is facilitated through the integration of [Azure App Configuration](/azure/azure-app-configuration/), [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview/), and the Split Experimentation Workspace.

## Experimentation in Azure App Configuration

This new feature experimentation, in Azure App Configuration, is built by integrating App Configuration with Application Insights and Split. As you go about setting up your first experiment, the key steps include creating and configuring the Azure resource setup for the experimentation flow.  

The below diagram depicts the Azure resources for experimentation and the high-level data flow for experiments.

To get started, follow the quickstart to [create a Split Experimentation Workspace](create.md),â€¯and then [set up the experiments for your application](../../azure-app-configuration/run-experiments-aspnet-core.md) in App Configuration store.

## Prerequisites

To set up an experimentation, either the Azure subscription Owner role or the combination of subscription Contributor and User Access Administrator roles is required.

## Billing

Split Experimentation Workspace (preview) is available through a pay-as-you-go monthly plan. With this plan, you receive the Split charges on your Azure monthly bill.

More information about pricing is available on [Azure Marketplace](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_Marketplace/GalleryItemDetailsBladeNopdl/id/splitio1614896174525.azure-experimentation).
