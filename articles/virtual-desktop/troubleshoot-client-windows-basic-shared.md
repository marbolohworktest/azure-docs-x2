There are a few basic troubleshooting steps you can try if you're having issues connecting to your desktops or applications:

1. Make sure you're connected to the internet.

1. Try to connect to your desktops or applications from the Azure Virtual Desktop web client. For more information, see [Connect to Azure Virtual Desktop with the Remote Desktop web client](users/connect-web.md).

1. Make sure you're using the latest version of the Remote Desktop client. By default, the client automatically updates when a new version is available. To check for updates manually, see [Update the client](./users/client-features-windows.md#update-the-client).

1. If the connection fails frequently or you notice performance issues, check the status of the connection. You can find connection information in the connection bar, by selecting the signal icon:

## Client stops responding or can't be opened

If the client stops responding or can't be opened, you might need to reset user data. If you can open the client, you can reset user data from the **About** menu. The default settings for the client will be restored and you'll be unsubscribed from all workspaces.

To reset user data from the client:

1. Open the *Remote Desktop* app on your device.

1. Select the three dots at the top right-hand corner to show the menu, then select **About**.

1. In the section **Reset user data**, select **Reset**. To confirm you want to reset your user data, select **Continue**.
