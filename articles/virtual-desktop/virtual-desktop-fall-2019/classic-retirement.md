# Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) retirement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This content applies to Azure Virtual Desktop (classic), which doesn't support Azure Resource Manager Azure Virtual Desktop objects.

Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) will retire on **September 30, 2026**. You should transition to Azure Virtual Desktop before that date.

[Azure Virtual Desktop](../overview.md) replaces Azure Virtual Desktop (classic). Here are some of the benefits of using Azure Virtual Desktop instead of Azure Virtual Desktop (classic):

- Deployments via Azure Resource Manager (ARM)
- Unified resource management
- Improved networking and security
- Scaling and automation features
- Feature availability and updates

## Retirement timeline

Beginning **September 30, 2023**, you'll no longer be able to create new Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) tenants. Existing Azure Virtual Desktop (classic) resources can still be managed, migrated, and are supported through **September 30, 2026**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have more than 500 application groups or manage multi-tenant environments, you can [request an exemption](#exemption-process).

## Required action

To avoid service disruptions, migrate to Azure Virtual Desktop before September 30, 2026. Here are some articles to help you migrate:

- [Migrate manually from Azure Virtual Desktop (classic)](../manual-migration.md)
- [Migrate automatically from Azure Virtual Desktop (classic)](../automatic-migration.md)
