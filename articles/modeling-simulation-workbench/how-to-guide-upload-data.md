# Import data into Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench

You can use Azure Modeling and Simulation Workbench to run your design applications in a secure and managed environment in Azure. This article explains how to upload files and import data into a chamber.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- An instance of Azure Modeling and Simulation Design Workbench installed with at least one chamber.
- A user provisioned as a Chamber Admin or Chamber User.
- [AzCopy](/azure/storage/common/storage-ref-azcopy) installed on the machine, with access to the configured network for the target chamber. Only machines on the specified network path for the chamber can upload files.

## Sign in to the Azure portal

Open your web browser and go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Enter your credentials to sign in to the portal.

## Browse to the chamber and get the upload URL

1. Enter **Modeling and Simulation Workbench** in the global search. Then, under **Services**, select **Modeling and Simulation Workbench**.

1. Select your workbench from the resource list.

1. On the left menu, select **Settings** > **Chamber**. A resource list appears. Select the chamber that you want to upload the data to.

1. In the chamber overview section, select the **Upload File** button.

1. In the **Upload File** pop-up dialog, copy the **Upload URL** value.

1. Use the AzCopy command to upload your file. For example, use `azcopy copy <sourceFilePath> "<uploadURL>"`.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Supported characters for the file name are alphanumeric characters, underscores, periods, and hyphens. Make sure that the file name does not have any spaces between characters, as it will cause the data import to fail.
   >
   > The data pipeline processes only files at the root. It doesn't process subfolders. If you're importing multiple smaller files, we recommend that you zip or tarball them into a single file.
   >
   > Gigabyte-sized tarballs and zipped files are supported, up to a maximum of 200GB per file. Ensure that each individual file is less than the maximum allowed size.

1. Confirm that the uploaded file resource with the source file name appears under **Chamber** > **Data Pipeline** > **File**.

A Chamber Admin or Chamber User can access the uploaded file from the chamber by accessing the following path: */mount/datapipeline/datain*.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're importing multiple smaller files, we recommend that you zip or tarball them into a single file. Gigabyte-sized tarballs and zipped files are supported, depending on your connection type and network speed. The `/mount/datapipeline/datain` directory has a volume size of 1TB, so if the imported dataset is larger than this, free up space by moving the files over to `/mount/chamberstorages/`.
>
> Note that the `/mount/datapipeline` volume is Azure Files based, whereas the `/mount/chamberstorages` volume is high-performance Azure NetApp Files. Always copy over the tools, binaries, and IP from the `/mount/datapipeline/datain` folder to `/mount/chamberstorages` volume under the specific chamberâ€™s private storage.
