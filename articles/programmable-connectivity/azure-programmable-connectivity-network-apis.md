# What are network APIs?
 
Network Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) can be utilized by software developers to build applications that can communicate with the underlying network. These APIs offer a uniform way for applications to access analytical and statistical data from networks, facilitating the implementation of customer experience based use cases. Network APIs can acquire network information and request configuration changes.  

Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) uses these network APIs to provide a unified standard interface across multiple operator networks globally while abstracting the complexities inherent to network APIs.  

APC is now available in public preview with several APIs, including number verification, SIM swap and other capabilities.
