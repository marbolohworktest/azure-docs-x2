# API Abstraction
 
Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) provides developers with a unified standard interface that abstracts away the intricacies of interacting with different network APIs. This abstraction shields developers from the nuances of various operators and network configurations, enabling them to focus solely on building innovative applications without the burden of constantly adapting to underlying network changes.  

With APC, developers can ensure that their code remains resilient and adaptable, even in the face of evolving network landscapes. Applications built on the APC platform maintain their functionality and performance over time, without requiring extensive rewrites or modifications due to network updates.
