# Consolidated Billing
 
By serving as a centralized marketplace, APC simplifies the procurement process while ensuring an exceptional user experience. Developers can conveniently select and subscribe to the network APIs they need without the hassle of dealing with multiple providers or complex billing systems.  

One of the key advantages of APC is its ability to consolidate billing, enabling developers to receive a unified invoice from Azure for all their API plans, rather than managing separate bills from various operators. This streamlined approach not only reduces administrative overhead but also enhances cost transparency and efficiency in managing network resources.
