# Automanage and Azure Disk Encryption

> [!CAUTION]
> On 31 August 2024, both Automation Update Management and the Log Analytics agent it uses will be retired. Migrate to Azure Update Manager before that. Refer to guidance on migrating to Azure Update Manager [here](/azure/update-manager/guidance-migration-automation-update-management-azure-update-manager?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Automation). [Migrate Now](https://portal.azure.com/).

Automanage is compatible with VMs that have Azure Disk Encryption (ADE) enabled.

## Azure Backup

If you are using the Production environment, you will also be onboarded to Azure Backup. There is one prerequisite to successfully using ADE and Azure Backup:
* Before you onboard your ADE-enabled VM to Automanage's Production environment, ensure that you have followed the steps located in the **Before you start** section of [this document](../backup/backup-azure-vms-encryption.md#before-you-start).

## Next steps

In this article, you learned that Automanage for machines provides a means for which you can eliminate the need for you to know of, onboard to, and configure best practices Azure services. In addition, if a machine you onboarded to Automanage for virtual machines drifts from the configuration profile, we will automatically bring it back into compliance.

Try enabling Automanage for Azure virtual machines or Arc-enabled servers in the Azure portal.
