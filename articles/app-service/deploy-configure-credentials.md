# Configure deployment credentials for Azure App Service
To secure app deployment from a local computer, [Azure App Service](./overview.md) supports two types of credentials for [local Git deployment](deploy-local-git.md) 
and [FTP/S deployment](deploy-ftp.md). These credentials are not the same as your Azure subscription credentials.

[!INCLUDE [app-service-deploy-credentials](../../includes/app-service-deploy-credentials.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> When [basic authentication is disabled](configure-basic-auth-disable.md), you can't view or configure deployment credentials in the Deployment Center.

## <a name="userscope"></a>Configure user-scope credentials

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Run the [az webapp deployment user set](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment/user#az-webapp-deployment-user-set) command. Replace \<username> and \<password> with a deployment user username and password. 

- The username must be unique within Azure, and for local Git pushes, must not contain the ‘@’ symbol. 
- The password must be at least eight characters long, with two of the following three elements: letters, numbers, and symbols. 

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment user set --user-name <username> --password <password>
```

The JSON output shows the password as `null`.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

You can't configure the user-scope credentials with Azure PowerShell. Use a different method, or consider [using application-scope credentials](#appscope). 

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

You can configure your user-scope credentials in any app's [resource page](../azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resources-portal.md#manage-resources). Regardless in which app you configure these credentials, it applies to all apps for all subscriptions in your Azure account. 

In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you must have at least one app before you can access the deployment credentials page. To configure your user-scope credentials:

1. From the left menu of your app, select > **Deployment center** > **FTPS credentials** or **Local Git/FTPS credentials**.

2. Scroll down to **User scope**, configure the **Username** and **Password**, and then select **Save**.

Once you have set your deployment credentials, you can find the *Git* deployment username in your app's **Overview** page,

![Shows how to find the Git deployment user name on your app's Overview page.](./media/app-service-deployment-credentials/deployment_credentials_overview.png)

If Git deployment is configured, the page shows a **Git/deployment username**; otherwise, an **FTP/deployment username**.

> [!NOTE]
> Azure does not show your user-scope deployment password. If you forget the password, you can reset your credentials by following the steps in this section.

## Use user-scope credentials with FTP/FTPS

Authenticating to an FTP/FTPS endpoint using user-scope credentials requires a username in the following format:
`<app-name>\<user-name>`

Since user-scope credentials are linked to the user and not a specific resource, the username must be in this format to direct the sign-in action to the right app endpoint.

## <a name="appscope"></a>Get application-scope credentials

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Get the application-scope credentials using the [az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment#az-webapp-deployment-list-publishing-profiles) command. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment list-publishing-profiles --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name>
```

For [local Git deployment](deploy-local-git.md), you can also use the [az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials](/cli/azure/webapp/deployment#az-webapp-deployment-list-publishing-credentials) command to get a Git remote URI for your app, with the application-scope credentials already embedded. For example:

```azurecli-interactive
az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --query scmUri
```
Note that the returned Git remote URI doesn't contain `/<app-name>.git` at the end. When you add the remote URI, make sure to append `/<app-name>.git` to avoid an error 22 with `git-http-push`. Additionally, when using `git remote add ... ` via shells that use the dollar sign for variable interpolation (such as bash), escape any dollar signs (`\$`) in the username or password. Failure to escape this character can result in authentication errors.

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Get the application-scope credentials using the [Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile](/powershell/module/az.websites/get-azwebapppublishingprofile) command. For example:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Get-AzWebAppPublishingProfile -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name>
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. From the left menu of your app, select **Deployment center** > **FTPS credentials** or **Local Git/FTPS credentials**.

    ![Shows how you can select the FTP dashboard from the Deployment center in Azure App Services.](./media/app-service-deployment-credentials/access-no-git.png)

2. In the **Application scope** section, select the **Copy** link to copy the username or password.

## Reset application-scope credentials

# [Azure CLI](#tab/cli)

Reset the application-scope credentials using the [az resource invoke-action](/cli/azure/resource#az-resource-invoke-action) command:

```azurecli-interactive
az resource invoke-action --action newpassword --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --resource-type Microsoft.Web/sites
```

# [Azure PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

Reset the application-scope credentials using the [Invoke-AzResourceAction](/powershell/module/az.resources/invoke-azresourceaction) command:

```azurepowershell-interactive
Invoke-AzResourceAction -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -ResourceType Microsoft.Web/sites -ResourceName <app-name> -Action newpassword
```

# [Azure portal](#tab/portal)

1. From the left menu of your app, select **Deployment center** > **FTPS credentials** or **Local Git/FTPS credentials**.

    ![Shows how you can select the FTP dashboard from the Deployment center in Azure App Services.](./media/app-service-deployment-credentials/access-no-git.png)

2. In the **Application scope** section, select **Reset**.
