# Common issues seen with Azure Virtual Network Manager

In this article, we cover common issues you may face when using Azure Virtual Network Manager and provide some possible solutions.

## Why isn't my configuration getting applied? 

**Common reasons for configurations not being applied:** 

* The configuration isn't deployed to the regions where virtual networks are located. 

* You haven't deployed the configuration yet. You need to deploy the configuration to have it take effect. 

* The configuration didn't have enough time to effect. The time it takes for the configuration to apply after you commit the configuration is around 15-20 minutes. When there's an update to your network group membership, it would take about 10 minutes for the changes to reflect. 

## I updated my configuration, but the changes aren't reflected in my environment. 

You need to deploy the new configuration after the configuration is modified. 

## Why is my connectivity configuration not working? 

**You'll need to consider the following items:** 

* In a hub-and-spoke topology, if you enable the option to *use the hub as a gateway*, you need to have a gateway in the hub virtual network. Otherwise, the creation of the virtual network peering between the hub and the spoke virtual networks fails. 

* If you want to have members in the network group to communicate with each other across regions in a hub and spoke topology configuration, you need to enable the global mesh option.
