### Create a Python Script

If you disabled the "Requires Client Authorization" option when creating the Relay,
you can send requests to the Hybrid Connections URL with any browser. For accessing
protected endpoints, you need to create and pass a SAS Token, which is shown here.

Here's a simple Python script that demonstrates sending requests to 
a Hybrid Connections URL with SAS Tokens utilizing WebSockets. 

### Dependencies

1. Install the following Python libraries using pip before running the client application

	`asyncio`, `json`, `logging`, `websockets`

	These libraries can be installed using the following command:

	```bash
	pip install <package name>
	```
2. Generate a `config.json` file to store your connection details

    ```json
	{
    "namespace": "HYBRID_CONNECTION_NAMESPACE",
    "path": "HYBRID_CONNECTION_ENTITY_NAME",
    "keyrule": "SHARED_ACCESS_KEY_NAME",
    "key": "SHARED_ACCESS_PRIMARY_KEY"
    }
    ```
	Replace the placeholders in brackets with the values you obtained when you created the hybrid connection.

    - `namespace` - The Relay namespace. Be sure to use the fully qualified namespace name; for example, `{namespace}.servicebus.windows.net`.
    - `path` - The name of the hybrid connection.
    - `keyrule` - Name of your Shared Access Policies key, which is `RootManageSharedAccessKey` by default.
    - `key` -   The primary key of the namespace you saved earlier.

3. Generate a helper function file for helper functions

	The following file is used as `relaylib.py` and have helper functions for WebSocket URL generation and SAS tokens

    [!INCLUDE [relay-python-helper-functions](relay-python-helper-functions.md)]

### Write some code to send messages

1. Ensure your dependency `config.json` and `relaylib.py` are available in your path 


2. Here's what your `sender.py` file should look like:

    ```python
	import asyncio
	import json
	import logging
	import relaylib
	import websockets

	async def run_application(message, config):
		service_namespace = config["namespace"]
		entity_path = config["path"]
		sas_key_name = config["keyrule"]
		sas_key = config["key"]
		service_namespace += ".servicebus.windows.net"

		# Configure logging
		logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)  # Enable debug logging

		token = relaylib.createSasToken(service_namespace, entity_path, sas_key_name, sas_key)
		logging.debug("Token: %s", token)
		wss_uri = relaylib.createListenUrl(service_namespace, entity_path, token)
		logging.debug("WssURI: %s", wss_uri)

		try:
			async with websockets.connect(wss_uri) as websocket:
				logging.info("Sending message to Azure Relay WebSocket...")
				await websocket.send(json.dumps({"message": message}))
				logging.info("Message sent: %s", message)
		except Exception as e:
			logging.error("An error occurred: %s", str(e))

	if __name__ == "__main__":
		# Load configuration from JSON file
		with open("config.json") as config_file:
			config = json.load(config_file)

		asyncio.run(run_application("This is a message to Azure Relay Hybrid Connections!", config))
    ```

> [!NOTE]
> The sample code in this article uses a connection string to authenticate to an Azure Relay namespace to keep the tutorial simple. We recommend that you use Microsoft Entra ID authentication in production environments, rather than using connection strings or shared access signatures, which can be more easily compromised. For detailed information and sample code for using the Microsoft Entra ID authentication, see [Authenticate and authorize an application with Microsoft Entra ID to access Azure Relay entities](../authenticate-application.md) and [Authenticate a managed identity with Microsoft Entra ID to access Azure Relay resources](../authenticate-managed-identity.md).
