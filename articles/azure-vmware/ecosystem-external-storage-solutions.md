# External storage solutions overview 

## External storage solutions for Azure VMware Solution 

Azure VMware Solution is a Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) service that offers VMware vSAN as the primary storage option. However, a significant requirement with on-premises VMware deployments is external storage, especially block storage. Providing the same consistent external block storage architecture in the cloud is crucial for some customers. Some workloads can't be migrated or deployed to the cloud without consistent external block storage. As a key principle of Azure VMware Solution is to enable customers to continue to use their investments and their favorite VMware solutions running on Azure, we engaged storage providers with similar goals.
