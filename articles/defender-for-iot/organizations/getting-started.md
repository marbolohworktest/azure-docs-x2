# Start a Microsoft Defender for IoT trial

This article describes how to set up a trial license and create an initial OT plan for Microsoft Defender for IoT, for customers who don't have any Microsoft tenant or Azure subscription at all. Use Defender for IoT to monitor network traffic across your OT networks.

A trial supports a **Large** site size with up to 1,000 devices. You might want to use this trial with a [virtual sensor](tutorial-onboarding.md) or on-premises sensors to monitor traffic, analyze data, generate alerts, understand network risks and vulnerabilities, and more.
