# Authorize a managed identity request by using Microsoft Entra ID

Azure Web PubSub Service supports Microsoft Entra ID for authorizing requests from [managed identities](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/overview.md).

This article shows you how to configure your Web PubSub resource and code to authorize the request to a Web PubSub resource from a managed identity.

## Configure managed identities

The first step is to configure managed identities.

In this section, you set up a system-assigned managed identity on a virtual machine by using the Azure portal.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), search for and then select a virtual machine (VM).
1. Under **Settings**, select **Identity**.
1. On the **System assigned** tab, set **Status** to **On**.

1. Select **Save** to confirm the change.

### Create a user-assigned managed identity

## Add a role assignment in the Azure portal

This section demonstrates how to assign the Web PubSub Service Owner role to a system-assigned identity for a Web PubSub resource.

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign a role to any scope, including management group, subscription, resource group, and single resource. For more information about scope, see [Understand scope for Azure RBAC](../role-based-access-control/scope-overview.md).

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), go to your Web PubSub resource.

1. On the left menu, select **Access control (IAM)** to display access control settings for your Web PubSub instance.

1. Select the **Role assignments** tab and view the role assignments at this scope.

   The following screenshot shows an example of the Access control (IAM) pane for a Web PubSub resource:

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity/access-control.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows an example of the Access control (IAM) pane.":::

1. Select **Add** > **Add role assignment**.

1. Select the **Roles** tab, and then select **Web PubSub Service Owner**.

1. Select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity/add-role-assignment.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows adding a role assignment.":::

1. Select the **Members** tab. Under **Assign access to**, select **Managed identity**.

1. Choose **Select Members**.

1. On the **Select managed identities** pane, select **System-assigned managed identity** > **Virtual machine**.

1. Search for and then select the virtual machine that you want to assign the role to.

1. Choose **Select** to confirm the selection.

1. Select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/howto-authorize-from-managed-identity/assign-role-to-managed-identities.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows assigning a role to managed identities.":::

1. Select **Review + assign** to confirm the change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure role assignments might take up to 30 minutes to propagate.
