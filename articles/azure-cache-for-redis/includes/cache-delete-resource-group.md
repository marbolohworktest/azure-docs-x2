## Clean up resources

If you want to continue to use the resources you created in this article, keep the resource group.

Otherwise, to avoid charges related to the resources, if you're finished using the resources, you can delete the Azure resource group that you created.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting a resource group is irreversible. When you delete a resource group, all the resources in the resource group are permanently deleted. Make sure that you do not accidentally delete the wrong resource group or resources. If you created the resources inside an existing resource group that has resources you want to keep, you can delete each resource individually instead of deleting the resource group.

### Delete a resource group

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and then select **Resource groups**.

1. Select the resource group to delete.

   If there are many resource groups, in **Filter for any field**, enter the name of the resource group you created to complete this article. In the list of search results, select the resource group.
