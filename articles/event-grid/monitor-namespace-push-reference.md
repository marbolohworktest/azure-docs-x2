| DroppedEvents | Dropped events | Number of events successfully received by Event Grid but later dropped (deleted) due to one of the following reasons: <br>- The maximum delivery count of a queue or push subscription has been reached and a dead-letter destination hasn't been configured or isn't available<br> - Events rejected by queue subscription clients and there's no dead-letter destination configured or isn't available. <br> -The time-to-live configured for the event subscription has been reached and there's no dead-letter destination configured or isn't available. |
