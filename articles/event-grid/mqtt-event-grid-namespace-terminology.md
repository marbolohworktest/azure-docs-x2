# Terminology

Key terms relevant for Event Grid namespace and MQTT resources are explained.



[!INCLUDE [common-namespace-concepts](./includes/common-namespace-concepts.md)]

## Client

Client is a device or an application that can publish and/or subscribe MQTT messages.  For more information about client configuration, see [MQTT clients](mqtt-clients.md).

## Certificate / Cert

Certificate is a form of asymmetric credential. They're a combination of a public key from an asymmetric keypair and a set of metadata describing the valid uses of the keypair. If the keypair of the issuer is the same keypair as the certificate, the certificate is said to be "self-signed". Third-party certificate issuers are sometimes called Certificate Authorities (CA).  For more information about client authentication, see [MQTT client authentication](mqtt-client-authentication.md).

## Client attributes

Client attributes represent a set of key-value pairs that provide descriptive information about the client. Client attributes are used in creating client groups and as variables in Topic Templates. For example, client type is an attribute that provides the client's type.  For more information about client configuration, see [MQTT clients](mqtt-clients.md).

## Client group

Client group is a collection of clients.  Clients can be grouped together using common client attribute(s). Client groups can be given permissions to publish and/or subscribe to a specific topic space.  For more information about client groups configuration, see [MQTT client groups](mqtt-client-groups.md).

## Topic space

Topic space is a set of topic templates. It's used to simplify access control management by enabling you to scope publish or subscribe access for a client group, to a group of topics at once instead of individual topics.  For more information about topic spaces configuration, see [MQTT topic spaces](mqtt-topic-spaces.md).

## Topic filter

An MQTT topic filter is an MQTT topic that can include wildcards for one or more of its segments, allowing it to match multiple MQTT topics. It's used to simplify subscriptions declarations as one topic filter can match multiple topics.

## Topic template

Topic templates are an extension of the topic filter that supports variables. It's used for fine-grained access control within a client group.

## Permission bindings

A Permission Binding grants access to a specific client group to either publish or subscribe on a specific topic space.  For more information about permission bindings, see [MQTT access control](mqtt-access-control.md).
