# Azure Storage Actions as an Event Grid source

This article provides the properties and schema for Azure Storage Actions events.Â For an introduction to event schemas, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). To learn more about Azure Storage Actions, see [What is Azure Storage Actions?](../storage-actions/overview.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure Storage Actions is currently in PREVIEW and is available these [regions](../storage-actions/overview.md#supported-regions).
> See the [Supplemental Terms of Use for Microsoft Azure Previews](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) for legal terms that apply to Azure features that are in beta, preview, or otherwise not yet released into general availability.
## Available event types

## Storage Actions events

These events are triggered when a storage task is queued and when a storage task run completes.

 |Event name |Description|
 |----------|-----------|
 | [Microsoft.StorageActions.StorageTaskQueued](#microsoftstorageactionsstoragetaskqueued-event) | Triggered when a storage task assignment run is queued. This event provides the status of assignment execution such as when the assignment is queued, and the corresponding execution ID for tracking purpose. |
 |[Microsoft.StorageActions.StorageTaskCompleted](#microsoftstorageactionsstoragetaskcompleted-event) | Triggered when a storage tasks assignment run is completed. This event provides the status of assignment execution such as when the assignment is completed, the assignment's status, which task is associated with the assignment, and the link to summary report file. |
