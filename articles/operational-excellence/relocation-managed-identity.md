# Relocate managed identities for Azure resources to another region

[!INCLUDE [relocate-reasons](./includes/service-relocation-reason-include.md)]

Moving user-assigned managed identities across Azure regions isn't supported.  You can however, recreate a user-assigned managed identity in the target region.

## Prerequisites

Managed identities for Azure resources is a feature of Azure Entra ID. Each of the Azure services that support managed identities for Azure resources is subject to its own timeline. 

- Make sure that you review the [availability status of managed identities for your resource](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/managed-identities-status)
- Understand [known issues with managed identities for Azure resources](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/known-issues).
- Create a dependency map with the Azure services that are used by the managed identity you wish to move. For the services that are in scope of a relocation, you must [select the appropriate relocation strategy](overview-relocation.md).

- Permissions to list permissions granted to existing user-assigned managed identity.
- Permissions to grant a new user-assigned managed identity the required permissions.
- Permissions to assign a new user-assigned identity to the Azure resources.
- Permissions to edit Group membership, if your user-assigned managed identity is a member of one or more groups.


## Downtime

To understand the possible downtimes involved, see [Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure: Select a relocation method](/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/relocate/select#select-a-relocation-method).


## Prepare and move

1. Copy user-assigned managed identity assigned permissions. You can list [Azure role assignments](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-list-powershell) but that may not be enough depending on how permissions were granted to the user-assigned managed identity. You should confirm that your solution doesn't depend on permissions granted using a service specific option.
1. Create a [new user-assigned managed identity](/entra/identity/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-powershell#create-a-user-assigned-managed-identity-2) at the target region.
1. Grant the managed identity the same permissions as the original identity that it's replacing, including Group membership. You can review [Assign Azure roles to a managed identity](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal-managed-identity), and [Group membership](/entra/fundamentals/groups-view-azure-portal).
1. Specify the new identity in the properties of the resource instance that uses the newly created user assigned managed identity.

## Verify

After reconfiguring your service to use your new managed identities in the target region, you must confirm that all operations have been restored.

## Clean up

Once that you confirm your service is back online, you can proceed to delete any resources in the source region that you no longer use.
