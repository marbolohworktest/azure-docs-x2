# Microsoft Copilot for Security and Defender EASM

Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management (Defender EASM) continuously discovers and maps your digital attack surface to provide an external view of your online infrastructure. This visibility enables security and IT teams to identify unknowns, prioritize risk, eliminate threats, and extend vulnerability and exposure control beyond the firewall. Attack Surface Insights are generated by analyzing vulnerability and infrastructure data to showcase the key areas of concern for your organization. 

Defender EASM’s integration with Copilot for Security enables users to interact with Microsoft’s discovered attack surfaces. These attack surfaces allow users to quickly understand their externally facing infrastructure and relevant, critical risks to their organization. They provide insight into specific areas of risk, including vulnerabilities, compliance, and security hygiene. For more information about Copilot for Security, go to [What is Microsoft Copilot for Security](/security-copilot/microsoft-security-copilot).  For more information on the embedded Copilot for Security experience, refer to [Query your attack surface with Defender EASM using Microsoft Copilot in Azure](/azure/copilot/query-attack-surface). 


**Copilot for Security integrates with Defender EASM**.

Copilot for Security can surface insights from Defender EASM about an organization's attack surface. You can use the system features built into Copilot for Security, and use prompts to get more information. This information can help you understand your security posture and mitigate vulnerabilities.

This article introduces you to Copilot for Security and includes sample prompts that can help Defender EASM users.

> Customers can still use Defender EASM skills if they have not purchased Defender EASM. See the Plugin capabilities reference section for more information. 




## Getting started 

Copilot for Security operates primarily with natural language prompts. When querying information from Defender EASM, you submit a prompt that guides Copilot for Security to select the Defender EASM plugin and invoke the relevant capability.  
For success with Copilot prompts, we recommend the following: 

- Ensure that you reference the company name in your first prompt. Unless otherwise specified, all future prompts will provide data about the initially specified company. 

- Be clear and specific with your prompts. You might get better results if you include specific asset names or metadata values (for example, CVE IDs) in your prompts.

  It might also help to add **Defender EASM** to your prompt, like:

  - **According to Defender EASM, what are my expired domains?**
  - **Tell me about Defender EASM high priority attack surface insights.**

- Experiment with different prompts and variations to see what works best for your use case. Chat AI models vary, so iterate and refine your prompts based on the results you receive.

- Copilot for Security saves your prompt sessions. To see the previous sessions, in Copilot for Security, go to the menu > **My sessions**.

## Switching between resource and company data 

Even though we have added resource integration for our skills, we still support pulling data from prebuilt attack surfaces for specific companies. To improve Copilot for Security’s accuracy in determining when a customer wants to pull from their attack surface or a prebuilt, company attack surface, we recommend using “my”, “my attack surface”, etc. to convey they want to use their resource and “their”, “{specific company name}”, etc. to convey they want a prebuilt attack surface. While this does improve the experience in a single session, we strongly recommend having two separate sessions to avoid any confusion. 


## Provide feedback

Your feedback on Copilot for Security generally, and the Defender EASM plugin specifically, is vital to guide current and planned development on the product. The optimal way to provide this feedback is directly in the product, using the feedback buttons at the bottom of each completed prompt. Select "Looks right," "Needs improvement" or "Inappropriate". We recommend “Looks right” when the result matches expectations, “Needs improvement” when it doesn't, and “Inappropriate” when the result is harmful in some way.  

Whenever possible, and especially when the result is “Needs improvement,” please write a few words explaining what we can do to improve the outcome. This also applies when you expected Copilot for Security to invoke the Defender EASM plugin, but another plugin was selected instead. 



## Data processing and privacy

When you interact with Copilot for Security to get Defender EASM data, Copilot pulls that data from Defender EASM. The prompts, the data that's retrieved, and the output shown in the prompt results is processed and stored within the Copilot for Security service.
