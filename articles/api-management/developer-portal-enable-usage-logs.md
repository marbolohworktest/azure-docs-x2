# Enable logging of developer portal usage in Azure API Management

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic.md)]

This article shows you how to enable Azure Monitor logs for auditing and troubleshooting usage of the API Management [developer portal](developer-portal-overview.md). When enabled through a diagnostic setting, the logs collect information about the requests that are received and processed by the developer portal.

Developer portal usage logs include data about activity in the developer portal, including:

* User authentication actions, such as sign-in and sign-out
* Views of API details, API operation details, and products
* API testing in the interactive test console

To configure a diagnostic setting for developer portal usage logs:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to your API Management instance.
