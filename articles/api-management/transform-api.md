# Tutorial: Transform and protect your API

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-all-tiers](../../includes/api-management-availability-all-tiers.md)]

In this tutorial, you learn about configuring common [policies](api-management-howto-policies.md) to transform your API. You might want to transform your API so it doesn't reveal private backend info. Transforming an API can help you hide the technology stack info that's running in the backend, or hide the original URLs that appear in the body of the API's HTTP response.

This tutorial also explains how to protect your backend API by configuring a rate limit policy, so that the API isn't overused by developers. For more policy options, see [API Management policies](api-management-policies.md).

> [!NOTE]
> By default, API Management configures a global [`forward-request`](forward-request-policy.md) policy. The `forward-request` policy is needed for the gateway to complete a request to a backend service.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

* Learn the [Azure API Management terminology](api-management-terminology.md).
* Understand the [concept of policies in Azure API Management](api-management-howto-policies.md).
* Complete the following quickstart: [Create an Azure API Management instance](get-started-create-service-instance.md).
* Also, complete the following tutorial: [Import and publish your first API](import-and-publish.md).

[!INCLUDE [api-management-navigate-to-instance.md](../../includes/api-management-navigate-to-instance.md)]

## Transform an API to strip response headers

This section shows how to hide the HTTP headers that you don't want to show to your users. For example, delete the following headers in the HTTP response:

* **X-Powered-By**
* **X-AspNet-Version**

### Test the original response

To see the original response:

1. In your API Management service instance, select **APIs**.
1. Select **Demo Conference API** from your API list.
1. Select the **Test** tab, on the top of the screen.
1. Select the **GetSpeakers** operation, and then select **Send**.

The original API response should look similar to the following response:

:::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/test-original-response-new.png" lightbox="media/transform-api/test-original-response-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the original API response in the portal.":::

As you can see, the response includes the **X-AspNet-Version** and **X-Powered-By** headers.

### Set the transformation policy

This example shows how to use the form-based policy editor, which helps you configure many policies without having to edit the policy XML statements directly.

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Design** > **All operations**.
1. In the **Outbound processing** section, select **+ Add policy**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/outbound-policy-small.png" alt-text="Screenshot of navigating to outbound policy in the portal." lightbox="media/transform-api/outbound-policy.png":::

1. In the **Add outbound policy** window, select **Set headers**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/set-http-header.png" alt-text="Screenshot of configuring the Set headers policy in the portal.":::

1. To configure the Set headers policy, do the following:
    1. Under **Name**, enter **X-Powered-By**. 
    1. Leave **Value** empty. If a value appears in the dropdown, delete it.
    1. Under **Action**, select **delete**.
    1. Select **Save**.

1. Repeat the preceding two steps to add a **Set headers** policy that deletes the **X-AspNet-Version** header:
  
1. After configuration, two **set-header** policy elements appear in the **Outbound processing** section.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/set-policy.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Set headers outbound policies in the portal.":::

## Replace original URLs in the body of the API response with API Management gateway URLs

This section shows how to replace original URLs that appear in the body of the API's HTTP response with API Management gateway URLs. You might want to hide the original backend URLs from users.

### Test the original response

To see the original response:

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Test**.
1. Select the **GetSpeakers** operation, and then select **Send**.

    As you can see, the response includes the original backend URLs:

    :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/original-response2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of original URLs in response in the portal.":::

### Set the transformation policy

In this example, you use the policy code editor to add the policy XML snippet directly to the policy definition.

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Design** > **All operations**.
1. In the **Outbound processing** section, select the code editor (**</>**) icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/outbound-policy-code.png" lightbox="media/transform-api/outbound-policy-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of navigating to outbound policy code editor in the portal.":::

1. Position the cursor inside the **`<outbound>`** element on a blank line. Then select **Show snippets** at the top-right corner of the screen.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/show-snippets-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting show snippets in outbound policy editor in the portal.":::

1. In the right window, under **Transformation policies**, select **Mask URLs in content**. 

    The **`<redirect-content-urls />`** element is added at the cursor.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/mask-urls-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot of inserting mask URLs in content policy in the portal.":::

1. Select **Save**.

## Protect an API by adding rate limit policy (throttling)

This section shows how to add protection to your backend API by configuring rate limits, so that the API isn't overused by developers. In this example, the limit is set to three calls per 15 seconds for each subscription ID. After 15 seconds, a developer can retry calling an API.

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Design** > **All operations**.
1. In the **Inbound processing** section, select the code editor (**</>**) icon.

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/inbound-policy-code.png" lightbox="media/transform-api/inbound-policy-code.png" alt-text="Screenshot of navigating to inbound policy code editor in the portal.":::

1. Position the cursor inside the **`<inbound>`** element on a blank line. Then, select **Show snippets** at the top-right corner of the screen.

    :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/show-snippets-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of selecting show snippets in inbound policy editor in the portal.":::

1. In the right window, under **Access restriction policies**, select **Limit call rate per key**. 

    The **`<rate-limit-by-key />`** element is added at the cursor. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/limit-call-rate-per-key.png" alt-text="Screenshot of inserting limit call rate per key policy in the portal.":::

1. Modify your **`<rate-limit-by-key />`** code in the  **`<inbound>`** element to the following code. Then select **Save**.

    ```
    <rate-limit-by-key calls="3" renewal-period="15" counter-key="@(context.Subscription.Id)" />
    ```

## Test the transformations

At this point, if you look at the code in the code editor, your policies look like the following code:

   ```
   <policies>
      <inbound>
        <rate-limit-by-key calls="3" renewal-period="15" counter-key="@(context.Subscription.Id)" />
        <base />
      </inbound>
      <backend>
        <base />
      </backend>
      <outbound>
        <set-header name="X-Powered-By" exists-action="delete" />
        <set-header name="X-AspNet-Version" exists-action="delete" />
        <redirect-content-urls />
        <base />
      </outbound>
      <on-error>
        <base />
      </on-error>
   </policies>
   ```

The rest of this section tests policy transformations that you set in this article.

### Test the stripped response headers

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Test**.
1. Select the **GetSpeakers** operation and select **Send**.

    As you can see, the **X-AspNet-Version** and **X-Powered-By** headers were removed:

    :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/stripped-response-headers.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing stripped response headers in the portal.":::

### Test the replaced URL

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Test**.
1. Select the **GetSpeakers** operation and select **Send**.

    As you can see, the URLs are replaced.

    :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/test-replaced-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing replaced URLs in the portal.":::

### Test the rate limit (throttling)

1. Select **Demo Conference API** > **Test**.
1. Select the **GetSpeakers** operation. Select **Send** four times in a row.

    After sending the request four times, you get the **429 Too Many Requests** response.

    :::image type="content" source="media/transform-api/test-throttling-new.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing Too Many Requests in the response in the portal.":::

1. Wait for 15 seconds or more and then select **Send** again. This time you should get a **200 OK** response.
