# Migrate an API Management instance hosted on the stv1 platform to stv2

[!INCLUDE [api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic](../../includes/api-management-availability-premium-dev-standard-basic.md)]

Here we help you find guidance to migrate your API Management instance hosted on the `stv1` compute platform to the newer `stv2` platform. [Find out if you need to do this](compute-infrastructure.md#how-do-i-know-which-platform-hosts-my-api-management-instance).

There are two different in-place migration scenarios, depending on whether or not your API Management instance is currently deployed (injected) in a VNet. Choose the migration guide for your scenario. 

[!INCLUDE [api-management-migration-alert](../../includes/api-management-migration-alert.md)]

## In-place migration scenarios

Migrate your instance in-place to the `stv2` platform using the **Platform migration** blade in the portal or the [Migrate to stv2](/rest/api/apimanagement/current-ga/api-management-service/migratetostv2) REST API.

* [**Scenario 1: Migrate a non-VNet-injected API Management instance**](migrate-stv1-to-stv2-no-vnet.md)    

* [**Scenario 2: Migrate a VNet-injected API Management instance**](migrate-stv1-to-stv2-vnet.md) 

## Alternative: Side-by-side deployment

While we strongly recommend using in-place migration to the `stv2` platform, you can also choose to deploy a new `stv2` instance side-by-side with your original API Management instance. Use API Management's [backup and restore](api-management-howto-disaster-recovery-backup-restore.md) capabilities to back up your original instance and restore onto the new instance. 

With side-by-side deployment, you can control the timing of deploying and verifying the new instance, whether to roll back (if needed) to the original instance, and when to decommission the original instance. This approach increases the costs because you run an additional instance for a period and requires more effort, but gives you full control over the migration process. For limitations and considerations, see [A guide to creating a copy of an API Management instance](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/a-guide-to-creating-a-copy-of-an-api-management-instance/ba-p/3971227).

The following image shows a high level overview of what happens during side-by-side migration.
