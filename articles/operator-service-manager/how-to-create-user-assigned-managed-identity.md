# Create and assign a User Assigned Managed Identity

In this how-to guide, you learn how to:
- Create a User Assigned Managed Identity (UAMI) for your Site Network Service (SNS).
- Assign that User Assigned Managed Identity permissions.

The requirement for a User Assigned Managed Identity and the required permissions depend on the Network Service Design (NSD) and must have been communicated to you by the Network Service Designer.

## Prerequisites

- You must have created a custom role via [Create a custom role](how-to-create-custom-role.md).  This article assumes that you named the custom role 'Custom Role - AOSM Service Operator access to Publisher.'

- Your Network Service Designer must have told you which other permissions your Managed Identity requires and which Network Function Definition Version (NFDV) your SNS uses.

- To perform this task, you need either the 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' role over the Network Function Definition Version resource from your chosen Publisher. You also must have a Resource Group over which you have the 'Owner' or 'User Access Administrator' role assignment in order to create the Managed Identity and assign it permissions.

## Create a User Assigned Managed Identity

Create a User Assigned Managed Identity. For details, refer to [Create a User Assigned Managed Identity for your SNS](/azure/active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/how-manage-user-assigned-managed-identities?pivots=identity-mi-methods-azp).

## Assign custom role

Assign a custom role to your User Assigned Managed Identity.

### Choose scope for assigning custom role

The publisher resources that you need to assign the custom role to are:

- The Network Function Definition Version(s)

You must decide if you want to assign the custom role individually to this NFDV, or to a parent resource such as the publisher resource group or Network Function Definition Group.

Applying to a parent resource grants access over all child resources. For example, applying to the whole publisher resource group gives the managed identity access to:
- All the Network Function Definition Groups and Versions.

- All the Network Service Design Groups and Versions.

- All the Configuration Group Schemas.

The custom role permissions limit access to the list of the permissions shown here:

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkFunctionDefinitionGroups/NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions/**use**/**action**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkFunctionDefinitionGroups/NetworkFunctionDefinitionVersions/**read**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkServiceDesignGroups/NetworkServiceDesignVersions/**use**/**action**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/NetworkServiceDesignGroups/NetworkServiceDesignVersions/**read**

- Microsoft.HybridNetwork/Publishers/ConfigurationGroupSchemas/**read**

> [!NOTE]
> Do not provide write or delete access to any of these publisher resources.

### Assign custom role

1. Access the Azure portal and open your chosen scope; Publisher Resource Group or Network Function Definition Version.

2. In the side menu of this item, select **Access Control (IAM)**.

7. Select **Review and assign**.

### Repeat the role assignment

Repeat the role assignment tasks for all of your chosen scopes.

## Assign Managed Identity Operator role to the Managed Identity itself

1. On the side menu, select **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. Choose **Add Role Assignment** and select the **Managed Identity Operator** role.

Completion of all the tasks outlined in this article ensures that the Site Network Service (SNS) has the necessary permissions to function effectively within the specified Azure environment.

## Assign other required permissions to the Managed Identity

Repeat this process to assign any other permissions to the Managed Identity that your Network Service Designer identified.
