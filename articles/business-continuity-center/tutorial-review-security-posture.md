# Review security posture (preview)

Azure Backup offers security features at the vault level to safeguard the backup data stored in it. These security measures encompass the settings associated with the Azure Backup solution for the vault and apply to the protected data sources contained within the vault.

Azure Business Continuity center (preview) allows you to view the Security level for each protected item from the Security posture view.

## View security level

Follow these steps to view the security level for protected items:

1. In Azure Business Continuity center, select the **Security posture** view under **Security + Threat management**.

2. In this view, you can see a list of all the protected items and their security level across subscription, resource groups, location, type, and so on, along with their properties.

3. To effectively look for specific items, you can utilize the various filters, such as subscriptions, resource groups, location, resource type, and so on. 

4.	Azure Business Continuity center allows you to change the default view using the **scope picker** from **Currently showing: Protection status details of Azure managed Active resources**, and select **Change**.

5. To change the scope for **Security posture** view from the scope picker, select the required options:
    - **Resource status**: 
        - **Active resources** - Resources that are currently active, which are not deleted.
        - **Deprovisioned resources** - Describes resources that no longer exist, yet their backup and recovery points are retained.

6. The BCDR Security assessment score shows the percentage and count of the protected items having adequate or maximum security.

7. Summary cards display an aggregated count for each security level, considering the applied filters. These cards can be selected to refine the filtering of the Protected items table. The security level reflects the security settings configured through the implemented solutions for data protection.

## Modify security level

In Azure Business Continuity center, you can change the security level for a protected item. 

Follow these steps to modify the security level for an item: 

1.	On the **Security posture** view under **Security + Threat management**, select **item name** for a datasource. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/tutorial-review-security-posture/select-item-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot shows the item name selection for a datasource." lightbox="./media/tutorial-review-security-posture/select-item-name.png":::

2.	On the item details page, you can view the vault used to protect the item. Select the vault name.

    It might take a while to get the security level settings implemented in Azure Business Continuity center.
