# Azure for Students Starter

The Azure for Students Starter program gets you started with the Azure products that you need to develop in the cloud. There's no cost to you. This benefit gives you access to a free tier of the following services:

- Azure App Service
- Azure Functions
- Azure Notification Hubs
- Azure Database for MySQL
- Application Insights feature of Azure Monitor
- Azure DevOps Server (formerly Visual Studio Team Foundation Server)

Azure for Students Starter is available to verified students without commitment or time limit. For more information, see the [terms and conditions for the Azure for Students Starter offer](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0144p/).

This offer isn't available for use in a massive open online course (MOOC) or in other professional trainings from for-profit organizations.

This offer is limited to one Azure for Students Starter subscription per eligible customer. It's nontransferable and can't be combined with any other offer, unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.

A credit card isn't required for the Azure for Students Starter offer. However, you can upgrade at any time to a pay-as-you-go subscription to get access to all Azure services, by using the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
