# Set up access for Azure Dev Tools for Teaching

There are two ways to access your subscription so that you can deploy software to your students and outfit your labs:

- Download software and keys from the Visual Studio subscription portal.
- Grant access for students to the Education Hub Store.

For more information, go to the [Azure for Education website](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com).

## For administrators only

Administrators access Azure developer tools through the [Visual Studio subscription portal](https://my.visualstudio.com/). To request access to the Visual Studio subscription portal, go to the [Azure Dev Tools for Teaching management portal](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/account/Subscriptions).

The first time that you access the Visual Studio subscription portal, you're prompted to link a Microsoft account with the email address that you provided when you enrolled. To link these accounts, you need your subscriber ID or benefits access number, along with the first and last name of an administrator. After you link your accounts, you can access the developer tools.

## For students and faculty

Students and faculty access Azure developer tools through the [Azure Education Hub](https://aka.ms/devtoolsforteaching), which is part of the Azure portal.

The Education Hub gives students access to the entire catalog of software, along with access to the entire [Microsoft Learn training](/training/) catalog.
