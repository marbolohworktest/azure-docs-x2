# What is Azure for Students?

[Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/students/) is a Microsoft program that provides students at higher-education institutions with access to various Azure cloud services and resources.

Joining Azure for Students grants you $100 in Azure credits, with no credit card required. This credit is valid for one year. You can renew each year that you're an active student to get an additional $100.

Your subscription includes free access to select versions of services like Azure Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, and more. You can deploy resources for these services after you join.

## Prerequisites

Azure for Students is available only to students who meet the following requirements:

- You must affirm that you're age 18 or older and attend an accredited, degree-granting, two-year or four-year educational institution where you're a full-time student.
- You must verify your academic status through your institution's email address.

This offer isn't available for use in a massive open online course (MOOC) or in other professional trainings from for-profit organizations.

This offer is limited to one Azure for Student subscription per eligible customer. It's nontransferable and can't be combined with any other offer, unless otherwise permitted by Microsoft.

For detailed terms of use, see the [Azure for Students offer page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0170p).
