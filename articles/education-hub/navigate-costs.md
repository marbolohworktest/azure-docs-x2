# Track usage and create budgets in Azure for Students

Azure for Students provides $100 in Azure credit to be used for up to one year. You can renew each year that you're an active student to get an additional $100. However, you need to effectively manage and conserve your credit to keep your services running throughout the year.

## Track your usage in the Education Hub

You can use the Azure Education Hub to keep track of your usage. The **Overview** page contains details about your Azure for Students subscription, such as monthly and aggregate usage and a countdown until your next renewal.

You can also select **View cost details** to open Microsoft Cost Management. With Cost Management, you can explore in more detail your services and the usage that they've accumulated.
