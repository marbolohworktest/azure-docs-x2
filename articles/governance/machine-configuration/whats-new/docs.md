# What's new in the Azure machine configuration docs

This document describes changes to the documentation that may be of interest to users and readers.
It doesn't include minor changes, like fixing typos or formatting. Instead, it lists new articles
and retired articles and any major changes to the documentation. This document provides historical
information starting in February of 2024.

## February 2024

In February, the documentation was reorganized and restructured to make it easier for readers to
navigate and enable the team to extend the documentation more easily in the future.

The team also removed the banner at the top of every page indicating the name change from Guest
Configuration to Azure Automanage machine configuration. The removed banner read:

> Azure Policy Guest Configuration is now called **Azure Automanage Machine Configuration**.
> [Learn more about the recent renaming of Microsoft configuration management services.][01]
