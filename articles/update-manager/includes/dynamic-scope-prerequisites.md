## Prerequisites

#### [Azure VMs](#tab/avms)

- Patch Orchestration must be set to Customer Managed Schedules. This sets **patch mode** to *AutomaticByPlatform* and the **BypassPlatformSafetyChecksOnUserSchedule** = *True*.
- Associate a Schedule with the VM.
             
#### [Arc-enabled VMs](#tab/arcvms)

There are **no prerequisites** for patch orchestration. However, you must associate a schedule with the VM for Schedule patching. For more information, see [Configure schedule patching on Azure VMs to ensure business continuity](../prerequsite-for-schedule-patching.md).
