# Azure HDInsight on AKS archived release notes

[!INCLUDE [retirement-notice](../includes/retirement-notice.md)]
[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](../includes/feature-in-preview.md)]


Azure HDInsight on AKS is one of the most popular services among enterprise customers for open-source analytics on Azure. If you would like to subscribe on release notes, watch releases on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Azure/HDInsight-on-aks/releases).

### Release date: Aug 05, 2024

**This release applies to the following**

- Cluster Pool Version: 1.2
- Cluster Version: 1.2.1
- AKS version: 1.27

### New Features

**MSI based SQL authentication**
Users can now authenticate external Azure SQL DB Metastore with MSI instead of User ID password authentication. This feature helps to further secure the cluster connection with Metastore.

**Configurable VM SKUs for Head node, SSH node** 
This functionality allows users to choose specific SKUs for head nodes, worker nodes, and SSH nodes, offering the flexibility to select according to the use case and the potential to lower total cost of ownership (TCO).

**Multiple MSI in cluster**
Users can configure multiple MSI for cluster admins operations and for job related resource access. This feature allows users to demarcate and control the access to the cluster and data lying in the storage account.
For example, one MSI for access to data in storage account and dedicated MSI for cluster operations.

### Updated

**Script action**
Script Action now can be added with Sudo user permission. Users can now install multiple dependencies including custom jars to customize the clusters as required. 

**Library Management**
Maven repository shortcut feature added to the Library Management in this release. User can now install Maven dependencies directly from the open-source repositories.

**Spark 3.4**
Spark 3.4 update brings a range of new features includes 
* API enhancements
* Structured streaming improvements
* Improved usability and developer experience

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To take benefit of all these **latest features**, you are required to create a new cluster pool with 1.2 and cluster version 1.2.1

### Known issues

- **Workload identity limitation:**
  - There's a known [limitation](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview#limitations) when transitioning to workload identity. This limitation is due to the permission-sensitive nature of FIC operations. Users can't perform deletion of a cluster by deleting the resource group. Cluster deletion requests must be triggered by the application/user/principal with FIC/delete permissions. In case, the FIC deletion fails, the high-level cluster deletion also fails.
  - **User Assigned Managed Identities (UAMI)** support – There's a limit of 20 FICs per UAMI. You can only create 20 Federated Credentials on an identity. In HDInsight on AKS cluster, FIC (Federated Identity Credential) and SA have one-to-one mapping and only 20 SAs can be created against an MSI. If you want to create more clusters, then you are required to provide different MSIs to overcome the limitation.
  - Creation of federated identity credentials is currently not supported on user-assigned managed identities created in [these regions](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-considerations#unsupported-regions-user-assigned-managed-identities) 

 
### Operating System version

- Mariner OS 2.0

### Release date: March 20, 2024

**This release applies to the following**

- Cluster Pool Version: 1.1
- Cluster Version: 1.1.1
- AKS version: 1.27


### New Features

**Apache Flink Application Mode Cluster**

Application mode clusters are designed to support dedicated resources for large and long-running jobs. When you have resource-intensive or extensive data processing tasks, you can use the [Application Mode Cluster](https://flink.apache.org/2020/07/14/application-deployment-in-flink-current-state-and-the-new-application-mode/#application-mode). This mode allows you to allocate dedicated resources for specific Apache Flink applications, ensuring that they have the necessary computing power and memory to handle large workloads effectively.  

For more information, see [Apache Flink Application Mode cluster on HDInsight on AKS](../flink/application-mode-cluster-on-hdinsight-on-aks.md).

**Private Clusters for HDInsight on AKS**

With private clusters, and outbound cluster settings you can now control ingress and egress traffic from HDInsight on AKS cluster pools and clusters.

- Use Azure Firewall or Network Security Groups (NSGs) to control the egress traffic, when you opt to use outbound cluster pool with load balancer.
- Use Outbound cluster pool with User defined routing to control egress traffic at the subnet level.
- Use Private AKS cluster feature - To ensure AKS control plane, or API server has internal IP addresses. The network traffic between AKS Control plane / API server and HDInsight on AKS node pools (clusters) remains on the private network only.
- Avoid creating public IPs for the cluster. Use private ingress feature on your clusters.

For more information, see [Control network traffic from HDInsight on AKS Cluster pools and cluster](../control-egress-traffic-from-hdinsight-on-aks-clusters.md).

**In place Upgrade**

Upgrade your clusters and cluster pools with the latest software updates. This means that you can enjoy the latest cluster package hotfixes, security updates, and AKS patches, without recreating clusters. For more information, see [Upgrade your HDInsight on AKS clusters and cluster pools](../in-place-upgrade.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To take benefit of all these **latest features**, you are required to create a new cluster pool with 1.1 and cluster version 1.1.1.
