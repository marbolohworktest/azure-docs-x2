## Summary

HDInsight on AKS is a modern, reliable, secure, and fully managed Platform as a Service (PaaS) that runs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). HDInsight on AKS allows you to deploy popular Open-Source Analytics workloads like Apache Spark™, Apache Flink®️, and Trino without the overhead of managing and monitoring containers.

You can build end-to-end, petabyte-scale Big Data applications span streaming through Apache Flink, data engineering and machine learning using Apache Spark, and Trino's powerful query engine.

All these capabilities combined with HDInsight on AKS’s strong developer focus enable enterprises and digital natives with deep technical expertise to build and operate applications that are right fit for their needs. HDInsight on AKS allows developers to access all the rich configurations provided by open-source software and the extensibility to seamlessly include other ecosystem offerings. This offering empowers developers to test and tune their applications to extract the best performance at optimal cost.

> To take benefit of all these **latest features**, you are required to create a new cluster pool with 1.2 and cluster version 1.2.1

### Known issues

- **Workload identity limitation:**
  - There's a known [limitation](/azure/aks/workload-identity-overview#limitations) when transitioning to workload identity. This limitation is due to the permission-sensitive nature of FIC operations. Users can't perform deletion of a cluster by deleting the resource group. Cluster deletion requests must be triggered by the application/user/principal with FIC/delete permissions. In case, the FIC deletion fails, the high-level cluster deletion also fails.
  - **User Assigned Managed Identities (UAMI)** support – There's a limit of 20 FICs per UAMI. You can only create 20 Federated Credentials on an identity. In HDInsight on AKS cluster, FIC (Federated Identity Credential) and SA have one-to-one mapping and only 20 SAs can be created against an MSI. If you want to create more clusters, then you are required to provide different MSIs to overcome the limitation.
  - Creation of federated identity credentials is currently not supported on user-assigned managed identities created in [these regions](/entra/workload-id/workload-identity-federation-considerations#unsupported-regions-user-assigned-managed-identities)
