If you're using Azure subscription first time for HDInsight on AKS, the following features might need to be enabled.

## Tenant registration

If you're trying to onboard a new tenant to HDInsight on AKS, you need to provide consent to first party App of HDInsight on AKS to Access API. This app tries to provision the application used to authenticate cluster users and groups.

> [!NOTE]
> Tenant admin would be able to run the command to provision the first party service principal on the given tenant.

**Commands**: 

```azurecli
az ad sp create --id d3d1a4fe-edb2-4b09-bc39-e41d342323d6
```

```azurepowershell
New-AzureADServicePrincipal -AppId d3d1a4fe-edb2-4b09-bc39-e41d342323d6
```

1. Click the Cloud Shell icon (:::image type="icon" source="./media/prerequisites-subscription/cloud-shell.png" alt-text="Screenshot screenshot showing Cloud Shell icon.":::) at the top right, and select **PowerShell** or **Bash** as your environment depending on the command you use.

                <br>If you receive a response that the registration is still ongoing (state in the response shows as "Registering"), wait for a few minutes. <br>Run the command again in few minutes and the state changes to "Registered" once feature registration is completed.

    az feature register --name EnablePodIdentityPreview --namespace "Microsoft.ContainerService" --subscription <Your Subscription>
    ```

    **Output:** The response indicates the registration is in progress (state in the response shows as "Registering"). It might take a few minutes to register the feature.

    ```

1. **Register with 'Microsoft.ContainerService' provider to propagate the features registered in the previous steps.**  
   
   ```azurecli
   az provider register -n Microsoft.ContainerService --subscription <Your Subscription>
   ```
    
    ```powershell
    Register-AzResourceProvider -ProviderNamespaceÂ Microsoft.ContainerService
    ```
