This article describes how to troubleshoot and resolve errors that could occur when you create Azure HDInsight on AKS clusters.

|Sr. No|Error message|Cause|Resolution|
|----|-----|-----|-----|
|1|InternalServerError  UnrecognizableError|This error could indicate an incorrect template used. Currently, database connectors are allowed only through ARM template. Hence the validation of configuration isn't possible on the template.| |
|2|InvalidClusterSpec - ServiceDependencyFailure - Invalid configuration|Max memory per node error.|Refer to the maximum memory configurations [property value types](https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/properties-resource-management.html#query-max-memory-per-node).|
|3|WaitingClusterResourcesReadyTimeOut - Metastoreservice unready|This error could be due to the container name may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens.  Container name must begin with a letter or a number.|Each hyphen must be preceded by and follow by a nonhyphen character. The name must also be between 3 and 63 characters long.|
|4|InvalidClusterSpec -Invalid configuration - ClusterUpsertActivity|Error: Invalid configuration property `hive.metastore.uri: may not be null`.|[Refer to the Hive connector documentation](https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/hive.html#connector-hive--page-root).|
|5|`InternalServerError - An exception has been raised that is likely due to a transient failure. Consider enabling transient error resiliency by adding 'EnableRetryOnFailure()' to the 'UseSqlServer' call`.||Retry the operation or open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|6|`InternalServerError - ObjectDisposedException` occurs in RP code.||Retry the operation or open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|7|`PreconditionFailed `- Operation failure due to quota limits on user subscription.|There's quota validation before cluster creation. But when several clusters are created under the same subscription at the same time, it's possible that the first cluster occupies the quota and the other fails because of quota shortage.|Confirm there's enough quota and retry cluster/cluster pool creation.|
|8|`ReconcileApplicationSecurityGroupError` - Internal AKS error||Retry the operation or open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|9|`ResourceGroupBeingDeleted`|During HDI on AKS resource creation or update, user is also deleting some resources in related resource groups.|Don't delete resources in HDI related resource groups when HDI on AKS resources are being created or updated.|

|13|`AuthorizationFailed - Scope invalid role assignment issue with managed RG and cluster msi`|Lack of permission to perform the operation.|Check if the service principle app ID mentioned in the error message owned by you. If yes,  grant the permission according to the error message. If no, open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|14|`DeleteAksClusterFailed - {"code":"DeleteAksClusterFailed","message":"An Azure service request has failed. ErrorCode: 'DeleteAksClusterFailed', ErrorMessage: 'Delete HDI cluster namespcae failed.

|15|`EntityStoreOperationError - ARM/AKS sdk error`|A database operation failed on AKS side during cluster update.|Retry the operation after some time. If the issue persists,  open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|16|`InternalServerError - {"exception":"System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException","message":"The operation was canceled."}`|This error caused due to various issues.|retry the operation or open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|

(Parameter 'roleAssignmentGuid')'"}`|This error caused due to various issues.|retry the operation or open a support ticket to Azure HDInsight team.|
|21|` OperationNotAllowed - {"code":"OperationNotAllowed","message":"An Azure service request has failed. ErrorCode: 'OperationNotAllowed', ErrorMessage: 'Service request failed.\\r\\nStatus: 409 (Conflict)\\r\\n\\r\\nContent:\\r\\n{\\ n \\"code\\": \\"OperationNotAllowed\\",\\ n \\"details\\": null,\\ n \\"message\\": \\"Operation  isn't allowed: Another agent pool operation (Scaling) is in progress, wait for it to finish before starting a new operation.`|Another agent pool operation (Scaling) is in progress.
