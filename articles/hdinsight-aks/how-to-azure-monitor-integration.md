# How to integrate with Log Analytics

[!INCLUDE [retirement-notice](includes/retirement-notice.md)]
[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](includes/feature-in-preview.md)]



This article describes how to enable Log Analytics to monitor & collect logs for cluster pool and cluster operations on HDInsight on AKS. You can enable the integration during cluster pool creation or post the creation.
Once the integration at cluster pool is enabled, it isn't possible to disable the integration. However, you can disable the log analytics for individual clusters, which are part of the same pool.

## Prerequisites

* Log Analytics workspace. You can think of this workspace as a unique logs environment with its own data repository, data sources, and solutions. Learn how to [create a Log Analytics workspace](/azure/azure-monitor/logs/quick-create-workspace?tabs=azure-portal) .

  > [!NOTE]
  > 1. Log Analytics must be enabled at cluster pool level first so as to enable it at a cluster level.
  > 
  > 2. The configuration at cluster pool level is a global switch for all clusters in the cluster pool, therefore all clusters in the same cluster pool can only flow log to one Log Analytics workspace.

## Enable Log Analytics using the portal during cluster pool creation

1. Sign in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
  
1. Select **Create a resource** and search for *cluster pool* in marketplace and select **Azure HDInsight on AKS Cluster Pool**. For more information on starting the cluster pool creation process, see [Create a cluster pool](quickstart-create-cluster.md#create-a-cluster-pool).
  
1. Navigate to the Integrations blade, select **Enable Log Analytics**.

1. From the drop-down list, select an existing Log Analytics workspace. Complete the remaining details required to finish cluster pool creation and select **Create**.
     
1. Log Analytics is enabled when the cluster pool is successfully created. All monitoring capabilities can be accessed under your cluster poolâ€™s **Monitoring** section.

## Enable Log Analytics using portal after cluster pool creation

1. In the Azure portal search bar, type "HDInsight on AKS cluster pools" and select *Azure HDInsight on AKS cluster pools* to go to the cluster pools page. On the HDInsight on AKS cluster pools page, select your cluster pool.

## Enable Log Analytics using the portal during cluster creation

1. In the Azure portal search bar, type "HDInsight on AKS cluster pools" and select *Azure HDInsight on AKS cluster pools* to go to the cluster pools page. On the HDInsight on AKS cluster pools page, select the cluster pool in which you want to create a cluster.

   > [!NOTE]
   > It is important to make sure that the selected cluster pool has Log Analytics enabled.

1. Select **New Cluster** to start the creation process. For more information on starting the cluster creation process, see [Create a cluster](./quickstart-create-cluster.md).

1. Navigate to the Integrations blade, select **Enable Log Analytics**.

1. Select one or more type of logs you would like to collect. Complete the remaining details required to finish the cluster creation and select **Create**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If no option is selected, then only AKS service logs will be available.

2. Log Analytics is enabled when the cluster is successfully created. All monitoring capabilities can be accessed under your cluster's **Monitoring** section.
