# Create a Trino cluster in the Azure portal (Preview)

[!INCLUDE [retirement-notice](../includes/retirement-notice.md)]
[!INCLUDE [feature-in-preview](../includes/feature-in-preview.md)]


This article describes the steps to create a Trino cluster with HDInsight on AKS by using the Azure portal. 

## Prerequisites

Complete the prerequisites in the following sections:

* [Subscription prerequisites](../prerequisites-subscription.md)
* [Resource prerequisites](../prerequisites-resources.md)
* [Create a cluster pool](../quickstart-create-cluster.md#create-a-cluster-pool)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For creating a cluster in new cluster pool, assign AKS agentpool MSI "Managed Identity Operator" role on the user-assigned managed identity created as part of resource prerequisite.
> 
> AKS agentpool managed identity gets created during cluster pool creation. You can identify the AKS agentpool managed identity by **(your clusterpool name)-agentpool**.
> Follow these steps to [assign the role](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal#step-2-open-the-add-role-assignment-page).

## Create a Trino cluster

Once the cluster pool deployment completes, continue to use the Azure portal to create a Trino cluster.

1. In the Azure portal, type *HDInsight cluster pools*/*HDInsight* and select **Azure HDInsight on AKS cluster pools** to go to the cluster pools page. On the HDInsight on AKS cluster pools page, select the cluster pool in which you want to add a new Trino cluster.

1. On the specific cluster pool page, click **+ New cluster** at the top left and then provide the following information:

     |Region|This field is autopopulated and shows the region selected on the cluster pool.|
     |Cluster pool|This field is autopopulated and shows the cluster pool name in which the cluster is now getting created. To create a cluster in a different pool, find that cluster pool in the portal and click **+ New cluster**.|
     |Cluster pool version|This field is autopopulated and shows the cluster pool version on which the cluster is now getting created.|
     |HDInsight on AKS Version | Select the minor or patch version of the HDInsight on AKS of the new cluster. For more information, see [versions](../versions.md).|

     |Cluster name |Enter the name of the new cluster.|
     |User-assigned managed identity | From the drop-down list, select the managed identity to use with the cluster. If you're the owner of the Managed Service Identity (MSI), and the MSI doesn't have Managed Identity Operator role on the cluster, click the link below the box to assign the permission needed from the AKS agent pool MSI. If the MSI already has the correct permissions, no link is shown. See the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) for other role assignments required for the MSI.|
     |Virtual network (VNet) | The virtual network for the cluster. it's derived from the cluster pool.|
     |Subnet|The virtual subnet for the cluster. it's derived from the cluster pool.|

     For **Hive catalog**, provide the following information:

    |Default storage for Hive catalog|From the drop-down list, select the default storage account to use for the Hive catalog.|
    |Container|Select the existing container in the default storage account for storing data and logs or create a new container.|

   > [!NOTE]
   >
   > * Currently, we support Azure SQL Database as in-built metastore.
   > * Due to Hive limitation, "-" (hyphen) character in the metastore database name is not supported.

   For more information, see [hive metastore](./trino-connect-to-metastore.md).
