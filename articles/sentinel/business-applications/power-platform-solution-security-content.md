## Built-in analytics rules

The following analytic rules are included when you install the solution for Power Platform. The data sources listed include the data connector name and table in Log Analytics. To avoid missing data in the inventory sources, we recommend that you don't change the default lookback period defined in the analytic rule templates.

| Rule name | Description | Source action | Tactics |
| --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
|PowerApps - App activity from unauthorized geo|Identifies Power Apps activity from countries in a predefined list of unauthorized countries.  <br><br> Get the list of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country codes from [ISO Online Browsing Platform (OBP)](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui).<br><br>This detection uses logs ingested from Microsoft Entra ID and requires that you also enable the Microsoft Entra ID data connector. |Run an activity in Power App from a country that's on the unauthorized country code list.<br><br>**Data sources**: <br>- Power Platform Inventory (using Azure Functions) <br>`InventoryApps`<br>`InventoryEnvironments`<br>- Microsoft Power Platform Admin Activity (Preview)<br>`PowerPlatformAdminActivity`<br>- Microsoft Entra ID<br>`SigninLogs`<br>|Initial access|

|Dataverse - Guest user exfiltration following Power Platform defense impairment|Identifies a chain of events starting with disablement of Power Platform tenant isolation and removal of an environment's access security group. These events are correlated with Dataverse exfiltration alerts associated with the impacted environment and recently created Microsoft Entra guest users.<br><Br>Activate other Dataverse analytics rules with the MITRE tactic 'Exfiltration' before enabling this rule.|As a recently created guest user, trigger Dataverse exfiltration alerts after the Power Platform security controls are disabled.<br><br>**Data sources:**<br>- PowerPlatformAdmin<br>`PowerPlatformAdminActivity`<br><br>- Dataverse<br>`DataverseActivity`<br>- Power Platform Inventory (using Azure Functions)<br>`InventoryEnvironments`<br>|Defense Evasion |
|Dataverse - Mass export of records to Excel|Identifies users exporting a large amount of records from Dynamics 365 to Excel.

## Built-in parsers

The solution includes parsers that are used to access data from the raw data tables. Parsers ensure that the correct data is returned with a consistent schema. We recommend that you use the parsers instead of directly querying the inventory tables and watchlists. The Power Platform inventory related parsers return data from the last 7 days.

|Parser  |Data returned  |Table queried |
|---------|---------|---------|
|`InventoryApps` | Power Apps Inventory | `PowerApps_CL`  |
|`InventoryAppsConnections` |  Power Apps connections Inventoryconnections       |  `PowerAppsConnections_CL`      |
|`InventoryEnvironments`   |Power Platform environments Inventory         |  `PowerPlatrformEnvironments_CL`       |
|`InventoryFlows`   |  Power Automate flows Inventory       |  `PowerAutomateFlows_CL`       |
|`MSBizAppsTerminatedEmployees`    | Terminated employees watchlist (from watchlist template)        |  `TerminatedEmployees`      |
|`GetPowerAppsEventDetails`| Returns parsed event details for Power Apps / Connections| `PowerPlatformAdminActivity` |
